114,"So is my Saviour by the cross, A ladder up to heaven."
115,我甚喜歡能佇立在主十架之下，
116,得脫猛烈中午暑火，得免太陽侵凌。
117,當日雅各雖然流落，曾得奇妙的夢，
118,主的十架今日於我，亦像梯通天城。
119,有位為我忍受罪譴，將要去世之狀；
120,"O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder,"
121,"Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,"
122,"I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,"
123,"Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed,"
124,"Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee:"
125,"""How great Thou art, how great Thou art!"""
126,"Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,"
127,"When through the woods and forest glades I wander,"
128,And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees:
129,"When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,"
130,And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze:
131,"And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing,"
132,"Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in:"
133,"That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,"
134,He bled and died to take away my sin.
135,"When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation"
136,"And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!"
137,"Then shall I bow, in humble adoration,"
138,"And there proclaim, ""my God, how great Thou art!"""
139,偉大的神﹐我每逢靜念默思﹐
140,祢手所創這偉大的世界﹔
141,我見眾星﹐又聞那隆隆雷聲﹐
142,祢的權能在全宇宙顯揭。
143,我魂歌頌﹐讚揚我主我神﹕
144,"""何等偉大﹗何等偉大﹗"""
145,當我經過綠蔭的樹林底下﹐
146,我聽鳥兒在那樹上鳴吟﹔
147,當我俯視山澗的流水迴縈﹐
148,微風迎面拂拭我的衣襟。
149,當我忖度﹐神不吝差遣愛子﹐
150,來為人死﹐實為人難領會﹔
151,十字架上﹐祂背負我的重擔﹐
152,流血與水﹐解決我雙重罪。
153,基督再臨﹐歡呼喝采盈天空﹐
154,欲提我去﹐我心欣然歡跳﹔
155,那日我必謙卑俯伏敬拜祂﹐
156,"並要宣揚﹐""我主我神奇妙。"""
157,"Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!"
158,"O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!"
159,"All ye who hear, now to His temple draw near;"
160,Join me in glad adoration!
161,"Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,"
162,"Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!"
163,Hast thou not seen how all thy longings have been
164,Granted in what He ordaineth?
165,"Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee."
166,Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.
167,"Ponder anew, what the Almighty can do,"
168,If with His love He befriend thee.
169,Praise to the Lord! Oh let all that is in me adore Him!
170,"All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!"
171,Let the Amen sound from His people again:
172,Gladly for aye we adore Him.
173,讚美我主﹐全能主神﹐受造萬有君王﹐
174,我心頌讚﹐因祂永遠是你救恩健康﹔
175,主民聽見﹐當來就近祂聖殿﹐
176,與我歡樂敬拜頌揚！
177,讚美我主﹐如此奇妙治理世界、萬有﹐
178,展開恩翼﹐如此溫柔將你遮蔽、護佑﹔
179,你豈不見﹕你一切所求所羨﹐
180,皆蒙主按祂旨成就?
181,讚美我主﹐扶助、保護﹐使你作工順利﹐
182,祂的美善﹐祂的恩惠必天天垂顧你﹔
183,且再思量﹕全能者愛何週詳﹐
184,祂是你友事事效力！
185,讚美我主﹐讓我全人向祢俯伏敬拜﹐
186,所有生靈同到祂前﹐獻上讚美愛戴﹐
187,"主的萬民﹐再同聲響應""阿們﹐"""
188,歡然獻上永遠敬拜！
189,"Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love;"
190,"Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee, opening to the sun above."
191,Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away;
192,"Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day!"
193,"All Thy works with joy surround Thee, Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,"
194,"Stars and angels sing around Thee, center of unbroken praise."
195,"Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea,"
196,"Chanting bird and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in Thee."
197,"Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blest,"
198,"Wellspring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happy rest!"
199,"Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are Thine;"
200,"Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine."
201,"Mortals join the mighty chorus, which the morning stars began;"
202,"Father love is reigning o'er us, brother love binds man to man."
203,"Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife;"
204,"Joyful music lifts us sunward, in the triumph song of life."
205,快樂﹐快樂﹐我們敬拜榮耀之主愛之神﹔
206,心如花開﹐到主面前﹐主如旭日﹐我歡迎。
207,苦意愁雲﹐懇求消化﹔疑惑黑蔭求散盡﹔
208,永恆快樂﹐求主賞賜﹐旭日光華滿我心。
209,主是不斷讚美中心﹐主所造物都歡欣﹔
210,群星、天使﹐團聚謳歌﹐天地反映主光明。
211,高山、幽谷﹐沃野、森林﹐草場積翠、波如鏡﹐
212,清歌小鳥﹐輕注流泉﹐喚起我們頌主心。
213,永遠賜福﹐永受尊榮﹐永遠赦免﹐永施恩﹐
214,生之快樂﹐活水源頭﹐歡樂安息海般深！
215,主是父親﹐基督是兄﹐愛中生活皆主民﹕
216,求教我們怎樣相愛﹐同享神聖大歡欣。
217,晨星引起偉大歌聲﹐奉勸萬民來響應﹔
218,父的慈愛統治我們﹐基督大愛繫羊群。
219,我們前進﹐歌唱不停﹐面對爭戰忠勇軍﹕
220,得勝生涯﹐凱歌聲裡﹐歡樂向神獻眾心。
221,"This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears"
222,"All nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres."
223,This is my Father's world: I rest me in the thought
224,"Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas- His hand the wonders wrought."
225,"This is my Father's world, the birds their carols raise,"
226,"The morning light, the lily white, declare their Maker's praise."
227,This is my Father's world: He shines in all that's fair;
228,"In the rustling grass I hear Him pass, He speaks to me everywhere."
229,"This is my Father's world, O let me ne'er forget"
230,"That tho' the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the Ruler yet."
231,This is my Father's world: Why should my heart be sad?
232,The Lord is King: let the heavens ring! God reigns: let earth be glad!
233,這是天父世界﹐我們側耳要聽﹐
234,宇宙歌唱﹐四圍響應﹐星辰作樂同聲。
235,這是天父世界﹐我心滿有安寧﹔
236,樹木花草﹐蒼天碧海﹐述說天父全能。
237,這是天父世界﹐小鳥展翅飛鳴﹐
238,清晨明亮﹐好花美麗﹐證明天理精深。
239,這是天父世界﹐祂愛普及萬千﹔
240,風吹之草將祂表現﹐天父充滿世間。
241,這是天父世界﹐求主叫我不忘﹔
242,罪惡雖然好像得勝﹐天父卻仍掌管。
243,這是天父世界﹐我心不必憂傷﹔
244,我主作王﹐天地同唱﹐歌聲充滿萬方。
245,主耶和華﹐我的力量﹐我心如何愛祢﹔
246,我的磐石﹐我的救主﹐我的一生歸依。
247,死亡急流漫淹我身﹐使我驚懼不已﹔
248,祢就側耳聽我微聲﹐伸手﹐當我危急。
249,祢從高天親自降臨﹐使天榮耀下垂﹔
250,在祢座前烈火如錦﹐射出重重光輝。
251,祢的道路何等純淨﹐話語何等精煉﹔
252,行祢慈愛﹐守祢完成﹐必蒙賜恩無限。
253,祢用聖火點著我燈﹐照明我的黑影﹔
254,使我能居高處安穩﹐因祢與我同行。
255,神聖能力﹐不要離我﹐一切服祢愛憐﹔
256,敵軍四圍﹐我能信託﹐如在秘密之天。
257,列國頌揚祢的名聲﹐只有祢是盾牌﹔
258,因祢所賜極大救恩﹐萬民都當敬拜。
259,"Immortal, invisible, God only wise,"
260,"In light in accessible hid from our eyes,"
261,"Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,"
262,"Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise."
263,"Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,"
264,"Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;"
265,Thy justice like mountains high soaring above
266,"Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love."
267,"To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small,"
268,"In all life Thou livest, the true life of all."
269,"We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,"
270,And wither and perish–but naught changeth Thee.
271,"Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,"
272,"Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;"
273,All praise we would render; O help us to see
274,'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee!
275,不能朽﹐不能見﹐獨一的真神﹐
276,住在不可迫視的光輝之境﹔
277,最可頌﹐最榮耀﹐亙古永長存﹐
278,又全能﹐又全勝﹐讚美主大名。
279,不止息﹐不焦急﹐如光無聲息﹐
280,無缺乏﹐無耗損﹐掌權以能力﹔
281,祢判斷憑公義如高山巍立﹐
282,祢施恩又施愛如靉雲普及。
283,賜生命與氣息予大小生靈﹐
284,活在萬有中﹐惟祢是真生命﹔
285,我們有如花草﹐今朝雖茂盛﹐
286,明朝即枯殘﹐惟祢永不變更。
287,榮耀之父四射純潔的光輝﹐
288,寶座前﹐天使無不掩面侍立﹔
289,我們向祢讚美﹐使我們領會
290,祇是神聖光華今將祢隱蔽。
291,"Blessing and honour and glory be Thine,"
292,"And glory be Thine, and glory be Thine."
293,Blessing and honour and glory be Thine
294,Both now and evermore.
295,Praise Him! Praise Him! All ye saints adore Him.
296,Praise Him! Praise Him! Both now and evermore! Hallelujah!
297,頌讚與尊貴並榮耀歸主﹐
298,願榮耀歸主﹐願榮耀歸主；
299,直到永永遠遠。
300,讚祂！讚祂！聖徒們﹐來敬拜祂。
301,讚祂！讚祂！直到永永遠遠。哈利路亞！
302,"We are never, never weary of the grand old song;"
303,"Glory to God, hallelujah!"
304,We can sing it loud as ever with our faith more strong;
305,"Oh, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing,"
306,"For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing,"
307,We are going by and by to the palace of a King!
308,We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love;
309,We are rising on its pinions to the hills above;
310,We are going to a palace that is built of gold;
311,Where the King in all His splendor we shall soon behold;
312,There we'll shout redeeming mercy in a glad new song;
313,There we'll sing the praise of Jesus with the blood-washed throng;
314,我們不會疲倦不唱這首舊詩章﹔
315,榮耀歸神﹐哈利路亞﹗
316,我們聲浪依舊﹐信心比前更堅強﹔
317,神的兒女有權利﹐可以大喊並大唱﹐
318,因為前途更光明﹐我們魂樂似飛翔﹐
319,不久我們到天上﹐就要朝見我君王﹐
320,我們浸沉在那救贖大愛、極樂中﹔
321,我們心中樂極有如插翅上高空﹔
322,我們所去之地乃是精金所建造﹔
323,那裡﹐我可面見我王所有的光耀﹔
324,那裡﹐我們要藉新詩喊出救贖恩﹔
325,那裡﹐我們要同眾聖擁擠耶穌身﹔
326,"Souls of men, why will ye scatter like a crowd of frightened sheep?"
327,"Foolish hearts, why will ye wander from a love so true and deep?"
328,"Was there ever kindest shepherd half so gentle, half so sweet,"
329,As the Saviour who would have us come and gather round His feet?
330,"There's a wideness in God's mercy, like the wideness of the sea;"
331,"There's a kindness in his justice, which is more than liberty."
332,There is no place where earth's sorrows are more felt than up in heaven;
333,There is no place where earth's failings have such kindly judgment given.
334,"There is welcome for the sinner, and more graces for the good;"
335,There is mercy with the Saviour; there is healing in His Blood.
336,There is grace enough for thousands of new worlds as great as this;
337,There is room for fresh creations in that upper home of bliss.
338,"For the love of God is broader than the measures of man's mind,"
339,And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind.
340,There is plentiful redemption in the Blood that has been shed;
341,There is joy for all the members in the sorrows of the Head.
342,"Pining souls! Come nearer Jesus, and oh come not doubting thus,"
343,But with faith that trusts more bravely His huge tenderness for us.
344,"If our love were but more simple, we should take Him at His word;"
345,And our lives would be all sunshine in the sweetness of our Lord.
346,世上罪人﹐為何徬徨、遁走、驚懼如迷羊﹖
347,愚頑靈魂﹐為何遠離不就主愛深似洋﹖
348,那有牧人可比耶穌溫柔、甘甜的一半﹖
349,祂是救主﹐按名招呼、引領迷羊入羊圈。
350,沒有一種寬廣﹐可比神懷中慈愛無疆﹔
351,沒有一種自由﹐可比公義之愛更釋放。
352,在地所有憂傷﹐無不在天更得祂慈慰﹐
353,在地所有失敗、頓挫﹐在天均得祂恩惠。
354,從無一種歡迎聲音﹐滿載恩典迎罪囚﹔
355,從無一位醫治救主﹐能抹寶血敷膏油。
356,在此有一浩大恩典﹐澤被所有憂傷魂﹐
357,在彼有一蒙福天鄉﹐廣納所有新造人。
358,因神的愛更是廣闊﹐勝過人心的度量﹔
359,永遠的愛不可捉摸﹐非常希奇不勉強。
360,神有充足豐富救贖﹐顯自流盡的寶血﹔
361,所有肢體都蒙祝福﹐在於元首的痛絕。
362,疲困靈魂﹐請親耶穌﹗請來﹐不要稍徘徊﹔
363,當以信心信得更固—祂心無盡的慈悲。
364,如果我愛更為簡單﹐就照祂話相信祂﹔
365,我的生命就更平安﹐只靠我主的提拔。
366,The love of God is greater far than tongue or pen can ever tell;
367,"It goes beyond the highest star, and reaches to the lowest hell;"
368,"The guilty pair, bowed down with care, God gave His Son to win;"
369,"His erring child He reconciled, and pardoned from his sin."
370,"Oh, love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong!"
371,"It shall forevermore endure, the saints' and angels' song."
372,"When hoary time shall pass away, and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;"
373,"When men who here refuse to pray, on rocks and hills and mountains call;"
374,"God's love, so sure, shall still endure, all measureless and strong;"
375,Redeeming grace to Adam's race the saints' and angels' song.
376,"Could we with ink the ocean fill, and were the skies of parchment made;"
377,"Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill, and ev'ry man a scribe by trade;"
378,To write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry;
379,"Nor could the scroll contain the whole, tho' stretched from sky to sky."
380,神的大愛真是遠超筆所能描、口所能陳﹔
381,它比最高星宿還高﹐它比最深地獄還深。
382,始祖犯罪﹐驚恐自危﹐神賜愛子來救﹔
383,當人痛悔﹐神就迎歸﹐所有罪案全勾。
384,哦﹗神的愛﹐何其豐富﹐何其無法測量﹗
385,它是堅強﹐存到永古﹐天使、聖徒同唱。
386,歲月消逝﹐榮華衰敗﹐天地廢去﹐事物更變﹐
387,人若拒絕神的大愛﹐那日惟有求助山巖﹔
388,神的大愛﹐不會改變﹐何其無法測量﹔
389,向人所顯救贖恩典﹐聖徒天使同唱。
390,縱令洋海盡是墨汁﹐無邊穹蒼都成白紙﹐
391,田間草桿根根筆枝﹐世上眾人個個文士﹔
392,若寫神的大愛無極﹐一切猶感缺欠﹔
393,墨乾﹐筆棄﹐紙罄﹐人敝﹐未能寫出半點。
394,"Father, 'twas Thy love that knew us, earth's foundation long before;"
395,"That same love to Jesus drew us, by its sweet constraining pow'r"
396,"And will keep us, and will keep us, safely now, and evermore."
397,Safely now and evermore.
398,"Now that changeless love enfolds us, all its wealth on us bestows,"
399,While its pow'r unchanging holds us in a holy calm repose.
400,"God and Father, God and Father, unto Thee our worship flows,"
401,Unto Thee our worship flows.
402,'Tis the Father's tender mercy that doth cause me to rejoice;
403,And myself am given wholly as a son thro' God's own choice.
404,God so loves us! God so loves us! That He gave us His dear Son!
405,That He gave us His dear Son!
406,"God of love, our souls adore Thee! We would still Thy grace proclaim"
407,"Till we cast our crowns before Thee, and in glory praise Thy name;"
408,"Praise and worship, praise and worship, be to God and to the Lamb,"
409,Be to God and to the Lamb!
410,父阿﹐久在創世之前﹐祢選我們愛無限﹔
411,這愛甘美、激勵、深厚﹐吸引我們親耶穌。
412,還要保守﹐還要保守﹐我們今後永穩固。
413,我們今後永穩固。
414,雖然宇宙逐漸改遷﹐但是我神總不變﹔
415,祂的愛心﹐同祂話語﹐向著我們永堅定。
416,神的兒女﹐神的兒女﹐我們應當讚祂名。
417,我們應當讚祂名。
418,神的憐憫﹐是我詩歌﹐我口所誇心所樂﹔
419,從始至終﹐惟有白恩﹐能得我命感我心。
420,神愛我們﹗神愛我們﹐連祂愛子都不吝﹗
421,連祂愛子都不吝﹗
422,愛的神阿﹐我們現在同心歌頌祢奇愛﹔
423,直到天上﹐遠離塵囂﹐我們仍是要稱揚。
424,但願榮耀﹐但願榮耀﹐永遠歸神和羔羊。
425,永遠歸神和羔羊。
426,我從我的受責心懷，流淚認二奇事：
427,一是祂的榮耀的愛，一是我的不值。
428,十架，我以你蔭庇，作我住處不改；
429,不論利益或是損失，都可任其失掉；
430,哦﹐神﹐是祢邀我們來看祢的兒子﹐
431,"What was it, blessed God, led Thee to give Thy Son,"
432,To yield Thy well beloved for us by sin undone?
433,"'Twas love unbounded led Thee thus,"
434,"'Twas love unbounded led Thee thus,"
435,To yield Thy well beloved for us.
436,"What led Thy Son, O God, to leave Thy throne on high,"
437,"To shed His precious blood, to suffer and to die?"
438,"'Twas love, unbounded love to us,"
439,Led Him to die and suffer thus.
440,"What moved Thee to impart Thy Spirit from above,"
441,Therewith to fill our heart with heavenly peace and love?
442,Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus.
443,"What love to Thee we owe, our God, for all Thy grace!"
444,Our hearts may well o'erflow in everlasting praise!
445,"Make us, O Lord, to praise Thee thus,"
446,For all Thy boundless love to us.
447,神阿﹐祢為何故賜下耶穌基督﹐
448,祢的親愛兒子﹐來為罪人受死？
449,無他﹐乃是祢的大愛﹐
450,叫祢這樣捨去心愛。
451,神﹐祢兒子為何離開天上寶座﹐
452,受苦直到命絕﹐流出祂的寶血？
453,無他﹐乃是祂的大愛﹐
454,叫祂這樣為我受害。
455,甚麼感動祢心﹐叫祢賜下聖靈﹐
456,帶來天上平安﹐充滿我們心坎？
457,叫祢這樣差遣祂來。
458,神阿﹐祢恩這大！我愛實在太差！
459,我心應當湧出感謝、讚美、歡呼。
460,求主使我﹐因祢大愛﹐
461,向祢歌頌直到萬代。
462,"O God, within the holy place,"
463,"Receive our worship, thanks, and praise,"
464,For Thy great love so precious.
465,"When we were sinners bound in sin,"
466,"Like prisoners locked their cells within,"
467,"Then, Thou Lord, came and freed us."
468,The riches of Thy boundless love
469,"Thy tender heart didst freely move,"
470,So Thou didst come and save us.
471,"Thou would'st not have poor sinners die,"
472,"But have them turn to Thee and cry,"
473,"""Thou art our God and Saviour."""
474,"In Thy dear Son, Thou didst us choose,"
475,"From sin, and death to set us loose,"
476,"And place us in His favour,"
477,"Now ""Abba Father,"" we may cry,"
478,"For in Thy Son, we are brought nigh"
479,And blessed in Him forever.
480,"But soon He'll come, and take His Own,"
481,"And have us with Him, round Thy Throne"
482,To worship and adore Thee.
483,Then shall Thy praise most sweetly sound
484,"To Heaven and earth's remotest bound,"
485,From that redeemed assembly.
486,"Yet now, O Lord, we long to raise"
487,"Our worship, homage, thanks, and praise"
488,And ever bow before Thee.
489,神哪，祢在聖所之內﹐
490,接受我們敬拜讚美﹐
491,因祢的愛何其真。
492,我們死在罪惡之中﹐
493,好像囚犯早已途窮﹐
494,祢就來釋放我們。
495,祢那無限豐富的愛﹐
496,感動祢以憐憫為懷﹐
497,祢就來拯救我們。
498,祢並不願罪人沉淪﹐
499,祢願他們回轉求懇
500,祢作他們的救主。
501,祢在子裡揀選我們
502,脫離罪和死亡圍困﹐
503,又使我們蒙永福。
504,我們今可來喊阿爸﹐
505,乃因祢子﹐不再懼怕﹐
506,坦然親近我們父。
507,不久祂接屬祂的人﹐
508,圍祢寶座﹐帶著他們
509,前來敬拜並讚美。
510,那時歌唱甜美聲浪﹐
511,要達天地最遠邊疆﹐
512,發自蒙贖的大會。
513,但是今日我們渴慕﹐
514,父阿﹐向祢敬拜俯伏﹐
515,同心歌唱祢恩惠！
516,"No blood, no altar now; the sacrifice is o'er!"
517,"No flame, no smoke ascends on high, the lamb is slain no more,"
518,"But richer blood has flow'd from nobler veins,"
519,"To purge the soul from guilt, and cleanse the reddest stains."
520,"We thank Thee for the blood, the blood of Christ, Thy Son:"
521,"The blood by which our peace is made, our victory is won:"
522,"Great victory o'er hell, and sin, and woe,"
523,"That needs no second fight, and leaves no second foe."
524,"We thank Thee for the grace, descending from above,"
525,"That overflows our widest guilt, th' eternal Father's love."
526,"Love of the Father's everlasting Son,"
527,"Love of the Holy Ghost, Jehovah, Three in One."
528,"We thank Thee for the hope, so glad, and sure, and clear;"
529,It holds the drooping spirit up till the long dawn appear;
530,Fair hope! with what a sunshine does it cheer
531,"Our roughest path on earth, our dreariest desert here."
532,We thank Thee for the crown of glory and of life;
533,"'Tis no poor with'ring wreath of earth, man's prize in mortal strife;"
534,"'Tis incorruptible as is the throne,"
535,The kingdom of our God and His incarnate Son.
536,沒有血﹐沒有壇﹐祭祀已成過去﹔
537,沒有煙冒﹐沒有火燃﹐犧牲再無必需。
538,更美的血流自更貴的脈﹔
539,洗淨人的污穢﹐清償人的罪債。
540,神﹐我們感謝祢﹐為祢兒子的血﹐
541,靠它我們被稱為義﹐靠它我們得捷。
542,大勝地獄、死亡、黑暗勢力﹔
543,毋需兩次爭戰﹐不留一個仇敵。
544,神﹐我們感謝祢﹐因有天來恩典﹔
545,漫過我們最闊不義﹐赦免最深罪愆。
546,我們要讚美祢所有的愛﹐
547,像祢榮耀、權柄、能力﹐存到萬代。
548,神﹐我們感謝祢﹐因為盼望堅固﹔
549,下沉的靈藉以再起﹐直至晨曦顯露。
550,有福的盼望﹐何等的鼓舞﹔
551,最疲倦的曠野﹐最艱難的道路。
552,神﹐我們感謝祢﹐為那榮耀之冠﹐
553,並非只有一時美麗﹐轉眼即已枯殘﹐
554,乃是像寶座不朽到永遠﹐
555,樂哉﹐能向寶座投下所有冠冕！
556,"By Thee, O God, invited, we look unto the Son,"
557,"In whom Thy soul delighted, who all Thy will hath done;"
558,"And by the one chief treasure, Thy bosom freely gave,"
559,"Thine own pure love we measure, Thy willing mind to save."
560,"O God of mercy — Father! The one unchanging claim,"
561,"The brightest hopes, we gather from Christ's most precious name:"
562,"What always sounds so sweetly in Thine unwearied ear,"
563,Has freed our souls completely from all our guilt and fear.
564,The trembling sinner feareth that God can ne'er forget;
565,But one full payment cleareth His memory of all debt.
566,"When nought beside could free us or set our souls at large,"
567,The death of God's Beloved secured a full discharge.
568,No wrath God's heart retaineth to usward who believe;
569,No dread in ours remaineth as we His love receive;
570,"Returning sons He kisses, and with His robe invests;"
571,His perfect love dismisses all terror from our breasts.
572,"O God, how canst Thou care for vile sinners such as we?"
573,"We only made Thee heartsore, we loathed Thy face to see."
574,"O wonder of all wonders, O mystery divine:"
575,"The One who spoke with thunders says, ""Sinner, I am thine."""
576,哦﹐神﹐是祢召我們來看祢的兒子﹐
577,祂是祢心的奇珍﹐祂行完祢意思﹔
578,我們因祢肯白捨祢的獨一心愛﹐
579,纔知祢心是真切要救我們脫害。
580,哦﹐聖父﹐憐憫的神﹐我們因子的名﹐
581,纔敢向祢常求恩﹐纔有永遠生命。
582,祢耳所常愛聽聞﹐悠揚如音樂的﹐
583,已叫我們的靈魂﹐脫盡所有猜疑。
584,戰兢罪人心常怕﹐祢永不忘先前﹐
585,但祂一次的受罰﹐使祢不再記念。
586,當無甚麼可以使我們得自由時﹐
587,父﹐祢愛子的受死﹐還了我們罪值。
588,祢對我們(信祂的)﹐心中已無忿怒﹐
589,我們現今也無忌﹐因知祢已眷顧﹔
590,回家兒女祢親嘴﹐並賜光明衣袍﹐
591,祢的慈愛已安慰我們心中苦惱。
592,哦﹐祢怎麼能喜歡我們這樣的人?
593,我們豈非使祢難﹐豈非見祢就恨?
594,哦﹐真稀奇﹐最稀奇！這是神聖奧秘！
595,"從前發聲如雷的﹐說﹕""罪人﹐我屬你！"""
596,戰兢罪人心常怕﹐神永不忘先前﹐
597,但是一次的受罰﹐使祂不再記念。
598,主耶穌祢的受死﹐還了我們罪值。
599,我們死在諸罪之中﹐
600,但是今日我們俯伏﹐
601,就先敬拜我神，我父。
602,祂領稱頌﹐祢耳何等樂聽祂的詩歌﹔
603,祢心豈非一樣用愛親近祂的從者﹔
604,祢心愛祂﹐遠在時間起首﹐
605,祢也定規我們作祂匹儔。
606,“ 阿爸，父啊，” 我們現在因奉主名到祢前；
607,祢的兒女聚集敬拜，願得應許的恩典！
608,祢靈已教我們呼叫祢為“ 阿爸” 近祢身。
609,我們從前好像浪子，無知離祢去流蕩；
610,但祢的恩比罪更多，拯救我們脫死亡。
611,給我們穿救恩衣裳，祢給我們坐筵席；
612,祢宰肥犢﹐祢傾福杯，恩典使我永不離。
613,“ 因我兒女死而復活；曾經失去又得著。”
614,不久我們同聚一處，在祢座前來溫故﹕
615,得與祂性情有分！
616,"Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness"
617,"My beauty are, my glorious dress;"
618,"'Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,"
619,With joy shall I lift up my head.
620,"Bold shall I stand in Thy great day,"
621,For who aught to my charge shall lay?
622,Fully absolved through these I am
623,"From sin and fear, from guilt and shame."
624,This spotless robe the same appears
625,When ruined nature sinks in years;
626,No age can change its constant hue;
627,Its glory is forever new.
628,Oh! Let the dead now hear Thy voice;
629,Now bid Thy banished ones rejoice;
630,"Their beauty this, their glorious dress,"
631,"Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness."
632,我主耶穌是我的義﹐
633,我的美麗﹐我的錦衣﹔
634,在寶座前服此盛裝﹐
635,我能抬頭歡樂歌唱。
636,藉祢寶血﹐我已脫去
637,我罪與過﹐我恥與懼﹔
638,審判大日我敢站立﹐
639,誰能控告主所稱義﹖
640,這件白衣永遠不變﹐
641,在那新造無窮時間﹔
642,歲月不能改其美豔﹐
643,基督白衣永遠新鮮。
644,直到寶座見祢榮耀﹐
645,我們仍要以祢自驕﹕
646,我的美麗﹐我的錦衣﹐
647,我主耶穌是我的義。
648,My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
649,"I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name."
650,On Christ the solid Rock I stand;
651,"All other ground is sinking sand, all other ground is sinking sand!"
652,"When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace;"
653,"In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil."
654,"His oath, His covenant, His blood, support me in the whelming flood;"
655,"When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay."
656,"When He shall come with trumpet sound, oh, may I then in Him be found,"
657,"Dressed in His righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne."
658,我的所有希望根基﹐在於基督公義寶血﹔
659,我不敢靠最好的義﹐我只敢靠祂的名牒。
660,基督磐石﹐我所穩踏﹐
661,其他地位都是流沙﹐其他地位都是流沙﹗
662,即有黑雲掩祂的臉﹐祂心不變﹐祂恩不移﹔
663,每次風浪雖欲漫淹﹐信心的錨拋牢幔裡。
664,祂血﹐祂約何等可靠﹐我名已經刻在祂手﹔
665,四圍雖然都能傾倒﹐祂仍存在永不棄守。
666,當祂再來﹐號筒吹響﹐那時我在祂內出現﹔
667,只穿祂的公義衣裳﹐無可指責被獻座前。
668,A mind at perfect peace with God;
669,"Oh, what a word is this!"
670,A sinner reconciled through blood;
671,"This, this indeed is peace!"
672,"By nature and by practice far,"
673,How very far from God;
674,"Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him,"
675,Through faith in Jesus' blood.
676,"So nigh, so very nigh to God,"
677,I cannot nearer be;
678,For in the person of His Son
679,I am as near as He.
680,"So dear, so very dear to God,"
681,More dear I cannot be;
682,"The love wherewith He loves the Son,"
683,Such is His love to me.
684,"Why should I ever anxious be,"
685,Since such a God is mine?
686,"He watches o'er me night and day,"
687,"And tells me ""Mine is thine."""
688,坦然無懼來到神前﹐
689,這真是從何說起！
690,一個罪人因著恩典﹐
691,竟可不再作仇敵！
692,我性﹐我行﹐都遠離神﹐
693,哎喲﹐離神何等遠！
694,現今因我信血受恩﹐
695,不再兩下隔天淵。
696,我極近神﹐近到如此﹐
697,已經不能再相近﹔
698,我因藉著祂的兒子﹐
699,就得像子那麼親。
700,神極愛我﹐愛到如此﹐
701,已經不能再珍愛﹔
702,祂是如何愛祂兒子﹐
703,照樣愛我不稍改。
704,我既得著這樣的神﹐
705,我心為何仍畏避﹖
706,祂之於我一往情深﹐
707,"祂對我說""我屬你！"""
708,"Praise, my soul, the King of heaven; to His feet thy tribute bring;"
709,"Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,"
710,Who like thee His praise should sing?
711,Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him!
712,Praise the everlasting King!
713,Praise Him for His grace and favour to our fathers in distress;
714,"Praise Him, still the same as ever,"
715,"Slow to chide, and swift to bless;"
716,Glorious in His faithfulness!
717,"Father-like He tends and spares us, well our feeble frame He knows;"
718,"In His hands He gently bears us,"
719,Rescues us from all our foes.
720,Widely as His mercy flows!
721,"We are weak, like flowers failing to withstand the wind and rain;"
722,All our strength is unavailing
723,But He constant will remain.
724,Everlasting is His reign.
725,"Angels, help us to adore Him, ye behold Him face to face!"
726,"Sun and moon, bow down before Him!"
727,"Dwelling all in time and space,"
728,Praise with us the God of grace!
729,我心﹐應當來稱頌主﹐帶你禮物來獻上﹔
730,被醫﹐被赦﹐被慰﹐被贖﹐
731,有誰如我心歡暢﹗
732,讚美！讚美！讚美！讚美！
733,讚美我神永遠王。
734,應當稱頌祂的恩典﹐列祖受苦祂眷顧﹔
735,讚美﹗至今祂並不變﹐
736,遲於責備快祝福﹔
737,祂的慈愛到永古。
738,祂像父親憐惜﹐悅納﹐我們軟弱祂深知﹔
739,祂心溫柔﹐不輕責打﹐
740,赦免﹐忍耐並扶持﹔
741,祂的慈愛無底止。
742,我們弱如野地花草﹐經風一吹就枯乾﹔
743,我們起來﹐我們跌倒﹐
744,神的寶座不改變﹔
745,祂是存在到永遠。
746,應當稱頌主耶和華﹐天使天軍都當來﹐
747,受造之物都當拜祂﹐
748,萬有無一可自外﹔
749,同我讚美神的愛。
750,來受貧窮、苦楚，祂從未推卻；
751,哦﹐這恩﹐帶我歸祂自己﹐
752,奇妙恩﹗帶我歸祂自己。
753,極其傷痛，大聲哀告，流汗猶如血滴。
754,耶穌獨自為我被鞭，鞭得皮裂肉綻；
755,獨自為我頭戴荊冕，被人羞辱侮慢。
756,耶穌獨自為我受死，在各各他山巔；
757,手足被釘，肋旁被刺，流血贖我罪愆。
758,而倚靠、鑑賞、稱羨享受祢﹐
759,祂的愛是如何深、高、闊、長﹐
760,真是預享天堂美福。
761,祢既受苦﹐祢又犧牲﹔
762,不然﹐恩典無門﹐來救千萬罪人﹔
763,祂不能救自己﹐必須完全公義﹔
764,為我﹐為我﹐祢的全捨﹔為祢﹐我棄一切。
765,恩典教導我心懼怕﹐
766,又將懼怕除掉﹔
767,恩典在我初信剎那﹐
768,有一血泉﹐血流盈滿﹐流自以馬內利﹔
769,立去全人罪跡。立去全人罪跡﹐立去全人罪跡。
770,罪人只要投身此泉﹐立去全人罪跡。
771,感謝祢在十架代死亡﹐耶穌﹗
772,主﹐我們願學祢式微﹐因這裡有安息。
773,我的救主﹐祢愛為何
774,"We praise Thee, O God, for the Son of Thy love,"
775,"For our Jesus, who died and is now gone above."
776,Hallelujah! Thine the glory! Hallelujah! Amen.
777,Hallelujah! Thine the glory! Revive us again.
778,"We praise Thee, O God, for Thy Spirit of light,"
779,Who has shown us our Saviour and scattered our night.
780,"All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain,"
781,Who has borne all our sins and has cleansed every stain.
782,"All glory and praise to the God of all grace,"
783,"Who has bought us, and sought us, and guided our ways."
784,神﹐我讚美祢﹐差遣祢的愛子﹐
785,釘死﹐復活﹐又升天﹐為我備居處﹐
786,哈利路亞﹐榮耀歸祢﹐哈利路亞﹐阿們﹗
787,哈利路亞﹐榮耀歸祢﹐感謝祢大恩。
788,神﹐我讚美祢﹐賜下亮光之靈﹐
789,啟示我的救贖主﹐開明我眼睛。
790,榮耀和讚美﹐歸給被殺羔羊﹐
791,祂已擔當我罪孽﹐洗淨我天良。
792,榮耀和讚美﹐歸於恩典的神﹐
793,祂曾尋我並買我﹐領我奔天程。
794,這摯﹗這寬﹗這博﹗
795,現今已得榮冕裝飾﹐並坐父的座位。
796,Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
797,哈利路亞！哈利路亞！
798,耶穌這名﹐慰我苦情﹐
799,有一個名我愛聽見，
800,我愛唱它價值；
801,猶如音樂美妙、甘甜，
802,地上無名如此。
803,因為祂先愛我。
804,這名說出救主的愛，
805,祂死使我自由；
806,祂的寶血已流出來，
807,神前說出美言。
808,這名說出我父為我，
809,每日所有部署；
810,眼前道路雖然陰暗，
811,陽光終必照出！
812,這名說出祂心有愛，
813,知我深處愁苦；
814,每一憂傷祂都擔代，
815,地上無人同負。
816,地上帳棚有日傾覆，
817,肉身已成過去；
818,幔內豐富何其真實，
819,永享生命歡欣。
820,"Yes, when the heart and flesh shall fail,"
821,"And mortal life shall cease,"
822,"I shall possess within the veil,"
823,A life of joy and peace.
824,"May wisdom, riches, honour and pow'r, His Kingship and glory"
825,"Be unto Christ, our Lamb of God, Throughout eternity."
826,"All praise to Him who reigns on high, In majesty supreme,"
827,"Who gave His life for man to die, that He might man redeem!"
828,"But children of the heav'nly King,"
829,"Before we reach the heav'nly fields,"
830,"We're marching through Immanuel's ground,"
831,主的子民既蒙深恩﹐
832,郇山佳果甜美豐盈，
833,我們昂首向前直往﹐
834,"Abba, Father, we adore Thee,"
835,Humbly now our homage pay;
836,"'Tis Thy children's bliss to know Thee,"
837,"None but children ""Abba"" say."
838,"This high honour we inherit,"
839,Thy free gift through Jesus' blood;
840,"God the Spirit, with our spirit,"
841,Witnesseth we're sons of God.
842,"Thine own purpose gave us being,"
843,"When in Christ, in that vast plan,"
844,Thou in Christ didst choose Thy people
845,E'en before the world began.
846,"Oh, what love Thou, Father, bore us!"
847,"Oh, how precious in Thy sight!"
848,"When to Thine own Son Thou gav'st us,"
849,"To Thy Son, Thy soul's delight."
850,Though our nature's fall in Adam
851,"Shut us wholly out from God,"
852,Thine eternal counsel brought us
853,Nearer still through Jesus' blood;
854,"For in Him we found redemption,"
855,Grace and glory in Thy Son;
856,O the height and depth of mercy!
857,Christ and His redeemed are one.
858,"Hence, through all the changing seasons,"
859,"Trouble, sickness, sorrow, woe,"
860,"Nothing changeth Thine affections,"
861,Love divine shall bring us through;
862,Soon shall all Thy blood-bought children
863,"Round the throne their anthems raise,"
864,"And in songs of rich salvation,"
865,Shout to Thine eternal praise.
866,阿爸﹐我們來頌讚祢﹐
867,我們謙卑敬拜祢﹔
868,我們現今得認識祢﹐
869,真是我們的福氣。
870,我們得著這樣權柄﹐
871,是因耶穌的尊名﹔
872,祢靈也和我們的靈﹐
873,證明我們有生命。
874,世界還未起首時候﹐
875,祢就在基督裡頭﹐
876,揀選我們作祢兒子﹐
877,好來成就祢美旨。
878,哦﹐父﹐祢是何等慈愛﹐
879,竟使我們蒙恩待﹗
880,好叫我們這些罪人﹐
881,得與祢性情有分﹗
882,我們天性在亞當裡﹐
883,真是敗壞無可比﹔
884,但是祢的永遠旨意﹐
885,預定我們歸於祢﹐
886,靠著救主我們得贖﹐
887,因重生稱祢為父﹔
888,救主﹐天父﹐教會合一﹐

937,In heaven's unclouded rays.
938,"There in the purpose of Thy love,"

985,直到同樂在那地。
986,"Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise with all Thine own;"
987,And in Thy presence sound a note of praise to Thee alone;
988,"Brought nigh, brought home to Thee, O wondrous grace,"
989,That gives us now with Thine own Son our place.
990,"How deep the holy joy that fills that scene, where love is known!"
991,"Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen, in Him alone;"
992,"As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,"
993,He leads the praise of those Thy love has blessed.
994,He leads the praise! How precious to Thine ear the song He sings!
995,"How precious, too, to Thee — how near, how dear are those He brings"
996,To share His place: 'Twas thus that Thou didst plan.
997,Thou lovedst Him before the world began.

1009,祢也定規我們與祂同儔。
1010,Behold! Behold! What manner of love the Father hath
1011,"Bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of God,"

1045,"To be our hope, our joy, our rest;"
1046,"The glories that compose Thy name,"
1047,Standing engaged to make us blest.
1048,Thou great and good! Thou just and wise!
1049,Hail! as our Father and our God!
1050,"For we are Thine by sacred ties,"
1051,Thy sons and daughters — bought with blood.
1052,"With fainting hearts we come to Thee,"
1053,"For Thee we long, to Thee we look;"
1054,"Forlorn, cast down, Thy grace we seek,"
1055,As pants the hart for cooling brook.
1056,"Then, oh! To us this grace afford,"
1057,That far from Thee we ne'er may move;
1058,Our guard — the presence of the Lord;
1059,Our joy — Thy perfect present love.
1060,"This gives us ever to rejoice,"
1061,Turning to light our darkest day;
1062,"And lifts on high each feeble voice,"
1063,While we have breath to praise or pray.
1064,父神啊﹐祢在羔羊裏
1065,是我的希望和安息；
1066,祢名所表一切慈仁﹐
1067,都是為著賜福我們。

1073,來到祢前仰望祢名﹔
1074,煩悶艱苦﹐尋求恩惠﹐
1075,如同困鹿渴慕溪水。
1076,既是這樣﹐願祢施恩﹐
1077,好叫我們親近祢身﹔
1078,祢的同在作我帳幕﹐
1079,祢的大愛作我喜樂。
1080,這叫我們永遠歡欣﹐
1081,這叫黑夜變為光明﹔

1256,I have a Friend whose faithful love is more than all the world to me.
1257,"'Tis higher than the heights above, and deeper than the soundless sea;"
1258,"So old, so new, so strong, so true, before the earth received its frame."
1259,"He loved me, blessed be His name!"

1262,"To seek the lost, and at the cost of heavenly rank and earthly fame"
1263,He sought me — blessed be His name!
1264,"It was a lonely path He trod, from every human soul apart;"
1265,"Known only to Himself and God was all the grief that filled His heart,"
1266,"Yet from the track He turned not back, till where I lay in want and shame,"
1267,He found me — blessed be His name!
1268,"Then dawned at last that day of dread when desolate, yet undismayed,"
1269,"With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head, He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,"
1270,"Was then made sin on Calvary, and dying there in grief and shame,"
1271,He saved me — blessed be His name!
1272,Long as I live my song shall tell the wonders of His dying love;
1273,"And when at last I rise to dwell in the bright home prepared above,"
1274,"My joy shall be His face to see, and bowing there with loud acclaim"

1276,我有一位奇妙救主﹐祂的愛情舉世莫如﹕
1277,深海雖深﹐它還要深；高天雖高﹐它還要高；
1278,亦新、亦陳﹐又摯、又真；不分境地﹐不理晚早。
1279,祂愛我﹐讚美祂的名﹗
1280,祂在天上位分至尊﹐天使、天軍無不拜頓；
1281,卻因情愛非常堅強﹐以至願意撇棄穹蒼﹐
1282,來尋迷羊﹐並且受戕﹐捨了天福﹐又失世賞﹐
1283,祂尋我﹐讚美祂的名﹗
1284,祂的道路實在孤單-沒有同心﹐沒有同伴﹔
1285,祂的所有患難、憂愁﹐惟祂自己和神知道﹔
1286,但祂前走﹐不稍退後﹐直等祂到我的囚牢-
1287,祂見我﹐讚美祂的名﹗
1288,"不久,悲慘日子就到﹕祂被人賣﹐祂被人告﹐"
1289,祂就如此-零丁孤苦﹐頭戴荊冕﹐身受鞭傷﹐
1290,為我之故﹐來髑髏處﹐忍辱、受死﹐疼痛獨當-
1291,祂救我﹐讚美祂的名﹗
1292,一生一世﹐我要述說﹕祂的愛情何等超絕﹗
1293,當我至終被提上天﹐住在祂所預備的家﹔
1294,我心所羨﹐是見祂面﹐並要高唱哈利路亞﹗
1295,我愛祂﹐讚美祂的名﹗
1304,"O Lord, when we the path retrace which Thou on earth hast trod,"
1305,"To man Thy wondrous love and grace, Thy faithfulness to God,"
1306,"Thy love, by man so sorely tried, proved stronger than the grave;"
1307,"The very spear that pierced Thy side, drew forth the blood to save."
1308,"Although Thou passed through woes and grief, Thy works were ever good;"
1309,"Although midst sorrows all Thy life, Thou spak'st no murmuring word."
1310,"Faithful amidst unfaithfulness, 'mid darkness only light,"
1311,"Thou did'st Thy Father's name confess, and in His will delight."
1312,"Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles, or suffering, shame, and loss,"
1313,"Thy path, uncheer'd by earthly smiles, led only to the cross."
1314,"We wonder at Thy lowly mind, and fain would like Thee be,"
1315,"And all our rest and pleasure find in learning, Lord, of Thee."
1316,哦﹐主﹐我們今想到祢在世所歷路程﹕
1317,祢以恩愛對待群黎﹐祢以忠誠對神。
1318,祢愛雖然被人辜負﹐顯為比死更強﹔
1319,刺祢的槍﹐不過引出血水﹐洗人天良。
1320,祢雖自己常經憂患﹐祢卻到處行善﹔
1321,雖然祢的路途艱難﹐祢卻不想怨歎。
1322,四圍不忠﹐祢卻赤忠﹔黑暗﹐祢卻光明。
1323,父的喜樂﹐祢心所重﹐從未違祂命令。
1324,不因撒但詭計搖動﹐不顧苦難損失﹔
1325,祢的行徑﹐無人同情﹐孤單一直到死。
1326,我們不禁奇祢謙卑﹐盼望能以像祢﹔
1327,主﹐我們願學祢低微﹐因這裡有安息。
1328,在加利利沿海之地﹐尋我恩主所留蹤跡﹔
1329,彷彿見主就在面前﹐向我顯示祂的慈顏。
1330,哦﹐加利利﹐小加利利﹐主常賁臨﹐施恩不棄﹔
1331,願你記念恩主腳跡﹐讓我讀出祂的心意。
1332,舉目看那暴風狂浪﹐一時恐懼、焦急、慌張﹔
1333,轉見船艙主正躺臥﹐祂斥風浪﹐我心快活。
1334,讓那喫餅五千群眾﹐追求物質﹐短暫虛空﹔
1335,但主既是天上活糧﹐有你滿足﹐魚餅何享﹖
1336,雖然有時你居彼岸﹐門徒搖櫓﹐孤苦哀歎﹔
1337,"卻有你手及時提攜﹐""是我﹐毋懼﹗""作我能力。"
1338,當主離去﹐我活若死﹐徒勞一夜﹐心灰意失﹔
1339,"晨曦揭露岸上榮形﹐""是主﹗""吸我棄船心傾﹗"
1340,炭火﹐魚餅顧我饑寒﹐愛我勝此﹐奪我心坎﹔
1341,"""主﹐你知道﹗""我有何言﹖惟獻全心﹐與主結聯。"
1342,可愛救主﹐寶貝救主﹐你的腳蹤﹐有口難述﹔
1343,願跟你蹤﹐願隨你行﹐讀你心意﹐模你榮形。
1344,"One day when heaven was filled with His praises,"
1345,"One day when sin was as black as could be,"
1346,Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin —
1347,"Dwelt among men, my example is He!"
1348,"Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;"
1349,"Buried, He carried my sins far away;"
1350,"Rising, He justified freely forever;"
1351,One day He's coming — O glorious day!
1352,"One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,"
1353,One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
1354,"Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;"
1355,"Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He!"
1356,"One day they left Him alone in the garden,"
1357,"One day He rested, from suffering free;"
1358,Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;
1359,"Hope of the hopeless, my Saviour is He!"
1360,"One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,"
1361,One day the stone rolled away from the door;
1362,"Then He arose, over death He had conquered;"
1363,"Now is ascended, my Lord evermore!"
1364,"One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,"
1365,"One day the skies with His glory will shine,"
1366,"Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;"
1367,"Glorious Saviour, this Jesus is mine!"
1368,有一日﹐天上充滿頌讚聲音﹐
1369,有一日﹐黑暗籠罩全人類-
1370,主耶穌竟然藉童女成肉身﹐
1371,住在人中間﹐顯出神光輝。
1372,祂生﹐為愛我﹗祂死﹐為救我﹗
1373,祂埋葬﹐為要除去我罪孽﹗
1374,祂復活而升天﹐我稱義得勝﹗
1375,一日祂再來﹐接我進榮耀﹗
1376,有一日﹐世人領祂到髑髏地﹔
1377,有一日﹐羞辱使祂心苦楚-
1378,被釘十架上﹐受神壓傷離棄﹐
1379,擔當我罪孽﹐成為我救主。
1380,有一日﹐世人留祂獨在園中﹔
1381,有一日﹐祂已安息無痛苦-
1382,天使從天來﹐看守祂的墓洞﹔
1383,無望者之望﹐是耶穌我主。
1384,有一日﹐墳墓不能將祂留藏﹔
1385,有一日﹐大石輥開不堵住-
1386,祂已復活了﹐祂已勝過死亡﹐
1387,升上到高天﹐永遠作我主。
1388,有一日﹐號筒傳報祂即再來﹔
1389,有一日﹐天空充滿祂榮光-
1390,哦﹐奇妙之日﹐祂帶聖徒回來﹐
1391,榮耀的救主﹐是萬王之王。
1392,"O Head once full of bruises, so full of pain and scorn,"
1393,"Mid other sore abuses, mocked with a crown of thorn;"
1394,"O Head, e'en now surrounded with brightest majesty,"
1395,In death once bowed and wounded on the accursed tree.
1396,Thou Countenance transcendent! Thou life-creating Sun!
1397,To worlds on Thee dependent — yet bruised and spit upon;
1398,"O Lord, what Thee tormented was our sins' heavy load,"
1399,We had the debt augmented which Thou didst pay in blood.
1400,"When we think of Thy suffering, how Thou didst give Thy life,"
1401,"Our hearts o'erflow with gladness, with praise and thankfulness."
1402,When o'er Thy death we ponder — upon the cruel tree;
1403,"Our lives we'd gladly give Thee, and count the loss as gain."
1404,"We give Thee thanks unfeigned, O Saviour, Friend in need,"
1405,For what Thy soul sustained when Thou for us didst bleed.
1406,"Grant us to lean unshaken upon Thy faithfulness,"
1407,"Until, to glory taken, we see Thee face to face."
1408,哦﹐滿了傷痕的頭﹐滿了痛苦誶詬﹐
1409,受盡萬般的試煉﹐又戴荊棘冠冕﹔
1410,這頭今日已得榮﹐已得聖徒歌詠﹐
1411,可憐當日受死傷﹐在加略木頭上。
1412,祢的面容原超凡﹐如同光明太陽﹔
1413,父神一見就悅納﹐竟受罪人唾打。
1414,主﹐祢所受的一切﹐都為我們罪孽﹔
1415,我們債務得清付﹐祢卻被人剪除。
1416,我們想到祢痛苦﹐又想到祢無辜﹔
1417,我們又滿心歡喜﹐又是感激無既﹗
1418,啊﹐當我們正如此念祢十字架時﹐
1419,就是生命全捨棄﹐損失還算利益。
1420,我們救主危難友﹐我們報恩無由﹗
1421,當祢流血為我死﹐祢的痛苦誰知﹖
1422,求祢使我從今後﹐天天記念髑髏﹐
1423,直到被提進榮耀﹐永遠與祢相交。
1424,"O sacred Head, now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down,"
1425,"Now scornfully surrounded with thorns, Thine only crown:"
1426,"O sacred Head, what glory, what bliss till now was Thine!"
1427,"Yet, though despised and gory, I joy to call Thee mine."
1428,"What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered was all for sinners' gain;"
1429,"Mine, mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain."
1430,"Lo, here I fall, my Saviour! 'Tis I deserve Thy place;"
1431,"Look on me with Thy favor, vouchsafe to me Thy grace."
1432,"What language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest friend,"
1433,"For this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end?"
1434,"O make me Thine forever: and should I fainting be,"
1435,"Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee."
1436,主﹐你聖首滿傷跡﹐憂羞使你頭垂﹔
1437,你的冠冕是荊棘﹐蔑視辱罵四圍。
1438,何等蒼白的臉面—濫被凌辱摧毀﹔
1439,從前發光的榮顏﹐如今何等憔悴。
1440,生命之主何榮耀﹐本享何等福樂﹔
1441,奇妙故事我知曉﹐今你所受為我。
1442,你的憂愁和苦情﹐皆為罪人福祉﹔
1443,我的所有乃惡行﹐你的卻是受死。
1444,為你受死的憂苦﹐為你恩憐無極﹔
1445,我口無語能盡述我心所有感激。
1446,使我屬你不變更﹐縱使我力敗頹﹔
1447,使我莫苟且偷生﹐若向你愛減退。
1448,"Gazing on the Lord in glory,"
1449,"While our hearts in worship bow,"
1450,There we read the wondrous story
1451,"Of the cross, its shame and woe."
1452,Every mark of dark dishonour
1453,"Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow,"
1454,All the depths of Thy heart's sorrow
1455,Told in answ'ring glory now.
1456,"On that cross, alone, forsaken,"
1457,Where no pity'ng eye was found;
1458,"Now to God's right hand exalted,"
1459,With Thy praise the heav'ns resound.
1460,"Did Thy God e'en then forsake Thee,"
1461,Hide His face from Thy deep need?
1462,"In Thy face, once marred and smitten,"
1463,All His glory now we read.
1464,"Gazing on it we adore Thee,"
1465,"Blessed, precious, holy Lord;"
1466,"Thou, the Lamb, alone art worthy —"
1467,This be earth's and heav'n's accord.
1468,"Rise our hearts, and bless the Father,"
1469,"Ceaseless song e'en here begun,"
1470,Endless praise and adoration
1471,To the Father and the Son.
1472,我們的靈伏著注視
1473,在榮耀裡的耶穌﹐
1474,我們在彼讀祂故事﹐
1475,如何在世受羞辱。
1476,祢的聖首滿了羞辱﹐
1477,世人竟然大歡暢﹔
1478,今日榮耀反面說出﹕
1479,當日祢心的憂傷。
1480,當祢掛在十字架時﹐
1481,孤單被棄無人憐﹔
1482,眾聖今則向祢唱詩﹐
1483,祢則高升到父前。
1484,神曾不顧祢的無告﹗
1485,神曾離棄祢不瞧﹗
1486,我們從祢憔悴面貌﹐
1487,現今看見父榮耀。
1488,寶貴的主﹗注視這個﹐
1489,我們不禁要讚美﹔
1490,但願天地同心唱和﹕
1491,"""神的羔羊﹐祢是配。"""
1492,我們的心應當起來﹐
1493,即今起來讚美父﹔
1494,但願歌頌、歡呼、愛戴﹐
1495,歸給父子到永古。
1507,On Calv'ry's brow my Saviour died. 'Twas there my Lord was crucified;
1508,"'Twas on the cross He bled for me, and purchased there my pardon free."
1509,O Calvary! Dark Calvary! Where Jesus shed His blood for me;
1510,O Calvary! Blest Calvary! 'Twas there my Saviour died for me.
1511,'Mid rending rocks and darkening skies my Saviour bows His head and dies;
1512,The opening veil reveals the way to life divine and endless day.
1513,"O Jesus, Lord, how can it be that Thou shouldst give Thy life for me,"
1514,To bear the cross and agony in that dread hour on Calvary!
1515,加略山巔﹐救主喪命﹐在彼受辱﹐在彼被釘﹔
1516,為我贖罪﹐為我流血﹔買來赦免﹐立了新約。
1517,慘哉﹐加略﹗痛哉﹐加略﹗在彼耶穌為我流血﹔
1518,大哉﹐加略﹗福哉﹐加略﹗在彼救主為我命絕。
1519,"磐石崩裂﹐天地昏暗﹔主喊""成了﹐""垂首氣斷﹔"
1520,殿幔中裂﹐活路開通﹔我得近神﹐蒙恩無窮。
1521,哦﹐主耶穌﹐怎會這樣-為我﹐祢竟甘心受戕﹖
1522,身懸木架受神責譴﹗在那慘痛加略山巔﹗
1523,"It was for me the Saviour died,"
1524,For me the fountain opened wide;
1525,The crimson blood flow'd from His side;
1526,"For me, yes, for me; for me, yes, for me."
1527,救主為我十架受害﹐
1528,救恩活泉為我大開﹔
1529,肋旁流血備受折磨—
1530,為我﹐是為我﹔為我﹐是為我。
1531,"Lord, Thy love has sought and found us wand'ring in this desert wide,"
1532,"Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us, for us suffered, bled, and died,"
1533,"Sing, my soul! He loved thee; Jesus gave Himself for me."
1534,Hark! What sounds of bitter weeping from yon lonesome garden sweep;
1535,'Tis the Lord His vigil keeping whilst His followers sink in sleep.
1536,"Ah, my soul, He loved thee, yes, He gave Himself for me."
1537,"He is speaking to His Father, tasting deep that bitter cup,"
1538,"Yet He takes it, willing rather for our sakes to drink it up."
1539,"Oh, what love! He loved me! Gave Himself, my soul, for thee."
1540,Then that closing scene of anguish: all God's waves and billows roll
1541,"Over Him, there left to languish on the cross, to save my soul."
1542,"Matchless love, how vast, how free, Jesus gave Himself for me."
1543,Hark again! His cries are waking echoes on dark Calvary's hill:
1544,"""God, My God, art Thou forsaking Him who always did Thy will?"""
1545,"Ah, my soul! It was for thee! Yes! He gave Himself for me."
1546,"Lord, we joy Thy toils are ended, glad Thy suff'ring time is o'er,"
1547,"To Thy Father's throne ascended, there Thou liv'st to die no more."
1548,"Yes, my soul! He lives for thee, He who gave Himself for me."
1549,"Lord, we worship and adore Thee for Thy rich, Thy matchless grace;"
1550,"Perfect soon in joy before Thee, we shall see Thee face to face,"
1551,"Yet e'en now our song shall be, ""Jesus gave Himself for me."""
1552,主﹐當我們漂流曠野﹐祢愛前來尋我們﹔
1553,祢用恩手逐步提挈﹐至終十架捨己身。
1554,唱罷﹐我魂﹐祂愛你﹔耶穌為我捨自己。
1555,聽哪﹐這是誰的哭聲﹐來自溪邊的荒園﹖
1556,這是我主儆醒守更﹐雖然門徒已疲倦。
1557,阿﹐我魂﹐祂真愛你﹔是的﹐祂為我捨己。
1558,此時﹐祂正對父求懇﹐深嘗義怒的滋味﹔
1559,但祂為著我們罪人﹐情願喝乾這苦杯。
1560,阿﹐愛﹗我魂﹐祂愛你﹗所以為你捨自己。
1561,再後﹐就是慘案末幕﹕神的波浪和洪濤﹐
1562,漫過祂身﹐使祂痛苦﹐纔好使我成新造。
1563,這愛無比又無極﹗耶穌為我捨自己。
1564,請再聽哪﹗祂在呼喊﹕–當祂見父與己分–
1565,"""神哪﹐神哪﹐祢竟摧殘那常順服祢的人﹖"""
1566,阿﹐我魂﹐這是為你﹔是的﹐祂為我捨己。
1567,主﹐我心樂﹐因祢苦難現今都已成往事﹔
1568,祢已升天坐父右邊﹐永遠活著不再死。
1569,那為我們捨己的﹐我魂今活著為祢。
1570,主﹐我們因祢的奇恩﹐現在敬拜頌讚祢﹔
1571,不久祢要成全我們﹐與祢相見同歡喜。
1572,"然而我們今唱說﹕""耶穌捨己為著我。"""
1583,When I survey the wondrous cross
1584,"On which the Prince of glory died,"
1585,"My richest gain I count but loss,"
1586,And pour contempt on all my pride.
1587,"Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,"
1588,Save in the cross of Christ my God;
1589,"All the vain things that charm me most,"
1590,I sacrifice them to His blood.
1591,"See from His head, His hands, His feet,"
1592,Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
1593,"Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,"
1594,Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
1595,"His dying crimson like a robe,"
1596,Spreads o'er His body on the tree;
1597,"Then am I dead to all the globe,"
1598,And all the globe is dead to me.
1599,"Were the whole realm of nature mine,"
1600,That were an offering far too small;
1601,"Love so amazing, so divine,"
1602,"Demands my soul, my life, my all!"
1603,我每靜念那十字架﹐
1604,並主如何在上受熬﹐
1605,我就不禁渾忘身家﹐
1606,鄙視從前所有倨傲。
1607,願主禁我別有所誇﹐
1608,除了基督的十字架﹔
1609,前所珍愛虛空榮華﹐
1610,今為祂血情願丟下。
1611,看從祂頭﹗祂腳﹗祂手﹗
1612,憂情慈愛和血而流﹗
1613,那有愛憂如此相遘﹐
1614,荊棘編成如此冕旒?
1615,看祂全身滿被水血﹐
1616,如同穿上朱紅衣飾﹔
1617,因此我與世界斷絕﹐
1618,世界向我也像已死。
1619,假若宇宙都歸我手﹐
1620,盡以奉主仍覺可羞﹔
1621,愛既如此奇妙深厚﹐
1622,當得我心、我命、所有。
1623,"Man of sorrows! What a name,"
1624,"For the Son of God, who came"
1625,Ruined sinners to reclaim!
1626,Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
1627,"Bearing shame and scoffing rude,"
1628,In my place condemned He stood;
1629,Sealed my pardon with His blood;
1630,"Guilty, vile, and helpless, we;"
1631,"Spotless Lamb of God was He,"
1632,Full atonement — can it be?
1633,"Lifted up was He to die,"
1634,"""It is finished!"" was His cry;"
1635,Now in heav'n exalted high;
1636,"When He comes, our glorious King,"
1637,"All His ransomed home to bring,"
1638,Then anew this song we'll sing:
1639,神的兒子從天至﹐
1640,竟然稱為憂患子﹐
1641,拯救罪人脫罪死。
1642,哈利路亞﹗何等救主﹗
1643,祂被人辱被人譏﹐
1644,代替我站罪人地﹔
1645,賜我生命賜我力。
1646,我們又弱又不好﹔
1647,祂是聖潔的羊羔﹐
1648,救贖竟然作得到﹗
1649,祂被舉起﹐我免死﹔
1650,祂說成了﹐鬼失勢﹔
1651,祂登寶座﹐給恩賜。
1652,當祂復臨遣天使﹐
1653,提接聖徒回家時﹐
1654,我們還要唱此詩﹕
1655,"Alas! And did my Saviour bleed? And did my Sov'reign die,"
1656,Would He devote that sacred head for such a worm as I?
1657,Was it for crimes that I had done He groaned upon the tree?
1658,Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree!
1659,"Well might the sun in darkness hide and shut his glories in,"
1660,"When Christ the mighty Maker died for man, the creature's sin."
1661,"Thus might I hide my blushing face while His dear cross appears,"
1662,Dissolve my heart in thankfulness; and melt mine eyes to tears.
1663,But drops of grief can ne'er repay the debt of love I owe.
1664,"Here, Lord, I give myself away; 'tis all that I can do."
1665,哎呀﹗救主真曾流血?真曾捨命亡躬﹖
1666,祂肯犧牲祂的超越﹐為我這個小蟲﹖
1667,祂在木上那樣哀歎﹐可是為我罪愆﹖
1668,憐憫何滿﹗慈愛何汎﹗恩典何其無邊﹗
1669,難怪太陽立變暗烏﹐隱藏一切榮光﹔
1670,當神基督造物的主﹐為人擔罪而亡。
1671,當我看見祂十字架﹐也當隱藏羞臉﹔
1672,心當溶化發出感嗟﹐眼當流淚自貶。
1673,但這滿腔憂傷﹐不能稍還主愛的債﹔
1674,主﹐我在此奉上一生﹐聊表此心感戴。
1675,"Merciful and loving, suff'ring pain and loss,"
1676,"All for us, the sinners, going to the cross;"
1677,"Tasting death for all men, dying for our sins;"
1678,"This is Christ the Saviour, what will you do with Him?"
1679,憐憫、慈愛、寬恕﹐溫柔又謙和﹔
1680,為了罪人忍辱﹐甘負十架軛﹔
1681,捨命、流血、受苦﹐為救失喪者﹔
1682,這是基督耶穌﹐對祂你如何﹖
1683,Christ has for sin atonement made; what a wonderful Saviour!
1684,"We are redeem'd, the price is paid; what a wonderful Saviour!"
1685,"What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus!"
1686,"What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord!"
1687,I praise Him for the cleansing blood; what a wonderful Saviour!
1688,That reconciled my soul to God; what a wonderful Saviour!
1689,He cleanses me from all my sin; what a wonderful Saviour!
1690,And now He reigns and rules within; what a wonderful Saviour!
1691,He walks beside me in the way; what a wonderful Saviour!
1692,And keeps me faithful day by day; what a wonderful Saviour!
1693,He gives me overcoming power; what a wonderful Saviour!
1694,And triumph in each trying hour; what a wonderful Saviour!
1695,To Him I've given all my heart; what a wonderful Saviour!
1696,The world shall never share a part; what a wonderful Saviour!
1697,基督已經完成贖罪﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1698,重價已付﹐我被贖回﹗何等奇妙的救主﹗
1699,何等奇妙的救主﹐是耶穌﹐我耶穌﹗
1700,何等奇妙的救主﹐是耶穌﹐我主﹗
1701,讚美祂血洗罪有效﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1702,使我這人與神和好﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1703,祂已洗淨我的罪愆﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1704,今在我心作王掌權﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1705,時時刻刻與我親近﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1706,天天保守使我忠心﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1707,得勝能力隨時賜與﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1708,使我爭戰奏凱有餘﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1709,我已向祂獻上全身﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1710,世界不能再分一份﹐何等奇妙的救主﹗
1711,"Lord, we treasure with affection"
1712,"All Thy path of sorrow here,"
1713,And those closing scenes of anguish
1714,To our hearts Thyself endear.
1715,"Praise Thee, Saviour! Praise Thee, Saviour!"
1716,"Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!"
1717,Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!
1718,Give Thee glory for the life we gain!
1719,"Deep Thy sorrow then, Lord Jesus,"
1720,Deeper far than thought can reach;
1721,"Grief intense and suff'rings holy,"
1722,Far beyond all tongues to teach.
1723,"None could follow there, blest Saviour,"
1724,When redemption's work was done;
1725,"For those suff'rings, deep, unfathomed,"
1726,"Were, Lord Jesus, Thine alone!"
1727,"Thou didst measure then sin's distance,"
1728,"Darkness, wrath and curse were Thine;"
1729,"Man-betrayed, by God forsaken;"
1730,Thus we learn Thy love divine!
1731,主﹐我寶貴祢的行徑﹐
1732,如何在此受苦害﹔
1733,那些最終悲痛情形﹐
1734,使我更覺祢可愛。
1735,讚美救主﹗讚美救主﹗
1736,讚美主為罪人死﹔
1737,榮耀救主﹗榮耀救主﹗
1738,榮耀﹐榮耀﹐主為死人活。
1739,主﹐祢當時艱難何大﹐
1740,大到無人會究推﹔
1741,無道摧殘﹐無理蹧蹋﹐
1742,痛苦有誰能微窺﹗
1743,可愛的主﹐當祢救贖﹐
1744,沒有一人能跟隨﹔
1745,因為許多定罪囚奴﹐
1746,需要祢獨受鞭錘。
1747,那時祢量罪的距離-
1748,忿怒﹐咒詛和悲哀﹐
1749,為人所賣﹐為神所棄﹔
1750,我們纔識祢可愛。
1751,"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee;"
1752,"Let the water and the blood, from Thy riven side which flowed,"
1753,"Be of sin the double cure, save me from its guilt and pow'r."
1754,Not the labors of my hands can fulfill Thy law's demands;
1755,"Could my zeal no respite know, could my tears forever flow,"
1756,All for sin could not atone; Thou must save and Thou alone.
1757,"Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to Thy cross I cling;"
1758,"Naked, come to Thee for dress, helpless, look to Thee for grace;"
1759,"Foul, I to the fountain fly, wash me, Saviour, or I die."
1760,"While I draw this fleeting breath, when mine eyes shall close in death,"
1761,"When I soar to worlds unknown, see Thee on Thy judgment throne,"
1762,"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee."
1763,永久磐石為我開﹐讓我藏身在祢懷﹔
1764,讓祢所流血與水﹐兩面醫治我的罪﹕
1765,使我得救能脫離罪的刑罰與能力。
1766,縱我雙手不罷休﹐不能滿足祢要求﹔
1767,縱我眼淚永遠流﹐縱我熱心能持久﹐
1768,這些不足贖愆尤﹔必須祢來施拯救。
1769,空空兩手無代價﹐單單投靠祢十架！
1770,赤身﹐就祢求衣衫﹔無助﹐望祢賜恩典﹔
1771,污穢﹐飛奔祢泉旁﹐主阿﹐洗我﹐否則亡。
1772,當我此生年日逝﹐當我臨終閉目時﹐
1773,當我飛進永世間﹐當我到祢寶座前﹐
1774,永久磐石為我開﹐讓我藏身在祢懷。
1775,"Jesus, keep me near the cross, there a precious fountain"
1776,"Free to all, a healing stream, flows from Calv'ry's mountain."
1777,"In the cross, in the cross, be my glory ever;"
1778,Till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river.
1779,"Near the cross, a trembling soul, love and mercy found me;"
1780,There the Bright and Morning Star sheds its beams around me.
1781,"Near the cross! O Lamb of God, bring its scenes before me;"
1782,Help me walk from day to day with its shadows o'er me.
1783,"Near the cross I'll watch and wait, hoping, trusting ever,"
1784,Till I reach the golden strand just beyond the river.
1785,求主使我近十架﹗在此有一寶泉﹐
1786,醫治活水﹐無代價﹐流自加略山巔。
1787,十字架﹗十字架﹗永是我的誇耀﹗
1788,等我被提到天家﹐仍是我的倚靠﹗
1789,前我戰兢就十架﹐得蒙愛憐、寬饒﹔
1790,明亮晨星的光華﹐在此仍將我照。
1791,哦﹐主﹐當我近十架﹐示我以其情景﹔
1792,在祢十架蔭庇下﹐天天助我前行。
1793,就近十架而儆醒﹐時時信靠、瞻仰﹔
1794,直到被提得上升﹐永遠見主面光。
1795,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,"
1796,The emblem of suff'ring and shame;
1797,And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
1798,For a world of lost sinners was slain.
1799,So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
1800,Till my trophies at last I lay down;
1801,"I will cling to the old rugged cross,"
1802,And exchange it some day for a crown.
1803,"Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,"
1804,Has a wondrous attraction for me;
1805,For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
1806,To bear it to dark Calvary.
1807,"In the old rugged cross stained with blood so divine,"
1808,A wondrous beauty I see;
1809,"For 'twas on that old cross, Jesus suffered and died"
1810,To pardon and sanctify me.
1811,"To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,"
1812,Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
1813,"Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,"
1814,Where His glory forever I'll share.
1815,在遠山聳立著古老的十字架﹐
1816,作為羞辱、痛苦標誌﹔
1817,我愛這十字架﹐因主離榮耀家﹐
1818,來在上面替人受死。
1819,我寶貴古老的十字架﹐
1820,一直到我俯伏主腳前﹔
1821,我堅持古老的十字架﹐
1822,等有天﹐我將它換冠冕。
1823,古老的十字架﹐不少人很輕視﹐
1824,對我卻有奇妙吸力﹔
1825,神聖潔的羔羊﹐曾降臨到此世﹐
1826,將它背至髑髏死地。
1827,古老的十字架﹐染斑斑的血跡﹐
1828,從我眼光何等可悅﹔
1829,"就在這十字架﹐主受苦到至極,"
1830,為要賜我赦免、聖潔。
1831,我永遠要效忠﹐古老的十字架﹐
1832,歡喜受它所受譏誚﹔
1833,有一天主召我歸回到祂的家﹐
1834,永遠享受祂的榮耀。
1839,"Beneath the Cross of Jesus, I fain would take my stand,"
1840,The shadow of a mighty Rock within a weary land;
1841,"A home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way;"
1842,"From the burning of the noontide heat, and the burden of the day."
1843,"Oh, safe and happy shelter! Oh, refuge tried and sweet!"
1844,"Oh, trusting place where heaven's love and heaven's justice meet."
1845,"As to the holy patriarch that wondrous dream was giv'n,"
1846,"So seems my Saviour's cross to me, a ladder up to heav'n."
1847,"There lies beneath its shadow, but on the farther side,"
1848,The darkness of an awful grave that gapes both deep and wide;
1849,"And there between us stands the cross, two arms outstretched to save,"
1850,Like a watchman set to guard the way from that eternal grave.
1851,Upon that cross of Jesus mine eye at times can see
1852,"The very dying form of One, who suffered there for me;"
1853,"And from my smitten heart, with tears, two wonders I confess,"
1854,"The wonders of His glorious love, and my own worthlessness."
1855,"I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place;"
1856,I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of His face;
1857,"Content to let the world go by, to know no gain nor loss,"
1858,"My sinful self my only shame, my glory all the cross."
1859,我何喜歡能站立﹐在主十架之下﹕
1860,猶如強大磐石蔭庇疲倦困苦之涯﹐
1861,猶如荒涼曠野居所﹐猶如路旁涼亭﹔
1862,得以卸下肩頭重擔﹐得免炎日侵凌。
1863,這是安全的蔭庇﹐可靠的避難所﹐
1864,是天的愛和天的義彼此相遇之處﹔
1865,當日雅各流落曠野﹐夢見奇妙異景﹐
1866,主的十架今日於我﹐亦像梯通天庭。
1867,安臥在主十架下﹐如臥天父懷中﹐
1868,地獄之門深廣可怖﹐從無滿足之日﹔
1869,十架站於生死之間﹐伸出拯救兩臂﹐
1870,引我安然進入天門﹐勝過死亡權勢。
1871,有時我眼能看見﹐在主十架之上﹐
1872,有位為我忍受罪刑﹐流血、流水而亡﹔
1873,我從我的震驚心懷﹐流淚認二奇事﹕
1874,一是祂愛無法測量﹔一是我的不值。
1875,十架﹐我以你蔭庇﹐作我永遠住處﹔
1876,我不要求其他親密﹐除祂親密之外。
1877,不論利益或是損失﹐對我均成無有﹔
1878,我的自己是我羞恥﹐十架是我榮耀。
1879,"Himself He could not save, He on the cross must die,"
1880,Or mercy could not come to ruined sinners nigh;
1881,"Yes, Christ, the Son of God, must bleed,"
1882,"That sinners might from sin be freed,"
1883,That sinners might from sin be freed.
1884,"Himself He could not save, for justice must be done;"
1885,Our sins' full weight must fall upon the sinless One;
1886,For nothing less can God accept
1887,"In payment of that fearful debt,"
1888,In payment of that fearful debt.
1889,"Himself He could not save, for He the Surety stood"
1890,For all who now rely upon His precious blood;
1891,He bore the penalty of guilt
1892,"When on the cross His blood was spilt,"
1893,When on the cross His blood was spilt.
1894,"Himself He could not save, what wondrous love is this!"
1895,In love Himself He gave there ne'er was love like His!
1896,Such love should melt a heart of stone
1897,Till praise flows forth to Him alone!
1898,祂不能救自己﹐必須死髑髏地﹔
1899,不然﹐恩典無門﹐來救荒涼罪人﹔
1900,真的﹐神兒子當流血﹐
1901,罪人纔能洗得清潔﹐
1902,罪人纔能洗得清潔。
1903,祂不能救自己﹐必須成全公義﹔
1904,我罪當有刑罰﹐需要祂來被殺﹔
1905,律法非此不算還債﹐
1906,非此﹐罪惡不能寬貸﹐
1907,非此﹐罪惡不能寬貸。
1908,祂不能救自己﹐因為祂是代替
1909,信祂的人站立在罪人的死地﹔
1910,祂在十字架上流血﹐
1911,擔當信徒一切罪孽﹐
1912,擔當信徒一切罪孽。
1913,祂不能救自己﹐這愛怎麼樣呢﹗
1914,祂不能救自己﹐這愛那有止極﹗
1915,我們的心雖然冷淡﹐
1916,這愛叫它發出感讚﹐
1917,這愛叫它發出感讚。
1918,"How pleasant is the sound of praise,"
1919,It well becomes the saints of God;
1920,"Should we refuse our songs to raise,"
1921,The stones might tell our shame abroad.
1922,"For Him who washed us in His blood,"
1923,Let us our sweetest songs prepare;
1924,"He sought us wandering far from God,"
1925,And now preserves us by His care.
1926,"One string there is of sweetest tone,"
1927,Reserved for sinners saved by grace;
1928,'Tis sacred to one class alone
1929,And touched by one peculiar race.
1930,Though angels may with rapture see
1931,"How mercy flows in Jesus' blood,"
1932,"It is not theirs to prove, as we,"
1933,The cleansing virtue of this flood.
1934,Though angels praise the heavenly King
1935,"And worship Him as God alone,"
1936,"We can with exultation sing,"
1937,"""He wears our nature on the throne."""
1938,"Lord, we adore Thy wondrous love,"
1939,Which brought Thee here to bleed and die
1940,That Thou lost sinners may restore
1941,And to the Father bring them nigh.
1942,頌讚聲音何等難得﹗
1943,所以應當無間時刻﹔
1944,如果我們自甘緘默﹐
1945,石頭也要說話相責。
1946,我們應當高聲頌美
1947,那用己血買我們的﹔
1948,祂替我們備嘗死味﹐
1949,祂為我們費盡心力。
1950,此世有一特別詩歌﹐
1951,惟獨蒙恩罪人會唱﹔
1952,此外無人懂那音樂﹐
1953,因不知其意義之綱。
1954,天使雖能歡然承認
1955,憐憫如何由血洞曉﹐
1956,但是他們不像我們
1957,能以證明這血功效。
1958,天使雖能讚美拜朝﹐
1959,說神是神﹐向神恭敬﹔
1960,我們卻能歡樂唱道﹔
1961,祂在寶座還帶人性﹗
1962,哦﹐主﹐我們讚美那使
1963,祢來流血受死的愛﹕
1964,但願不久在天相值﹐
1965,向祢讚美﹐向祢敬拜。
1966,"Of all the gifts Thy love bestows, Thou Giver of all good!"
1967,E'en heav'n itself no richer knows than Jesus and His blood.
1968,"Faith, too, that trusts the blood through grace, from that same love we gain;"
1969,"Else, sweetly as it suits our case, the gift had been in vain."
1970,"O Love divine, Thou vast abyss! Our sins buried in Thee,"
1971,"Cover'd is our unrighteousness, from all debts we are free."
1972,"In Jesus' blood our hearts can trace the footprints of Thy love,"
1973,"And know the riches of Thy grace, the holy righteousness."
1974,"Though heart may fail and flesh decay, on firm ground we remain,"
1975,"When earth and heav'n shall pass away, our anchor shall sustain."
1976,"Until that day, we then shall prove, the full worth of Thy love."
1977,"But here on earth, my life still needs Thy great sustaining power."
1978,"We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more, to Thee our all we owe;"
1979,"The precious Saviour, and the power that makes Him precious too."
1980,祢愛所給雖然甚多﹐恩賜眾善者哪！
1981,但在天上﹐還未見過什麼比血更大。
1982,就是我的信心對血﹐也是祢愛所給﹔
1983,不然恩賜雖合所缺﹐也是虛空無益。
1984,哦﹐神的愛﹐祢是深海﹐我罪都埋裡面﹔
1985,我的不義﹐祢都遮蓋﹐虧欠﹐祢都赦免。
1986,在寶血裡﹐我已尋出祢愛心的蹤跡﹔
1987,由此我知祢的寬恕﹐並知祢的公義。
1988,心會軟弱﹐身會衰頹﹐我總安然相信﹔
1989,天地雖然都要銷毀﹐我錨已經拋定。
1990,到了那時﹐我要證明祢愛有何價值﹔
1991,但在今日﹐我的生命就先靠它扶持。
1992,當讚美祢！再讚美祢！有何不是祢給﹕
1993,寶貴救主﹐和那使彼顯為寶貴的力。

2035,"Oh, loving kindness, faithful and true!"
2036,"Find peace and shelter under the blood,"
2037,耶穌﹐我救主﹐作神羔羊﹐
2038,為罪人受死﹐罪債清償﹐
2039,將祂的寶血灑你身上﹐
2040,神必越過你﹐你免滅亡。
2041,"""我一見這血﹐我一見這血﹐"
2042,"我一見這血﹐我就必越過你﹐不毀滅﹗"""
2043,罪中的罪魁﹐耶穌肯救﹐
2044,凡祂所應許﹐祂必成就﹔
2045,在祂這血下﹐雖有愆尤﹐
2046,神必越過你﹐你得寬宥。
2047,審判要來到﹐無人免除﹔
2048,在神公義前﹐誰能立足﹖
2049,惟有讓祂血將你掩護﹐
2050,神必越過你﹐你得站住。
2051,哦﹐憐憫何大﹗哦﹐愛無邊﹗
2052,哦﹐神聖恩典﹐豐盛、甘甜﹗
2053,在血蔭蔽下享受平安﹐
2054,神必越過你﹐你要頌讚﹗

2083,有一血泉﹐血流盈滿﹐湧自耶穌肋邊﹔
2084,罪人只要投身此泉﹐
2085,立去全人罪愆。立去全人罪愆﹐立去全人罪愆。
2086,罪人只要投身此泉﹐立去全人罪愆。
2087,當日一盜﹐臨終歡欣﹐因見此泉效能﹔

2110,無窮年日﹐父耳所聽﹐惟獨羔羊的名。
2111,Would you be free from the burden of sin?
2112,"There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;"

2138,"In fancy I stood by the shore, one day,"
2139,Of the beautiful murm'ring sea;
2140,I saw the great crowds as they thronged the way
2141,Of the Stranger of Galilee;
2142,"I saw how the man who was blind from birth,"
2143,In a moment was made to see;
2144,The lame was made whole by the matchless skill
2145,Of the Stranger of Galilee.
2146,"And I felt I could love Him forever,"
2147,So gracious and tender was He!
2148,"I claimed Him that day as my Saviour, this Stranger of Galilee."
2149,"His look of compassion, His words of love,"
2150,"They shall never forgotten be,"
2151,"When sinsick and helpless He saw me there,"
2152,This Stranger of Galilee;
2153,"He show'd me His hand and His riven side,"
2154,"And He whispered, ""It was for thee!"""
2155,My burden fell off at the pierced feet
2156,"I heard Him speak peace to the angry waves,"
2157,"Of that turbulent, raging sea;"
2158,"And lo! at His word are the waters stilled,"
2159,"A peaceful, a quiet, and holy calm,"
2160,Now and ever abides with me;
2161,"He holdeth my life in His mighty hands,"
2162,This Stranger of Galilee.
2163,"Come ye, who are driven, and tempest-tossed,"
2164,And His gracious salvation see;
2165,"He'll quiet life's storms with His ""Peace, be still,"""
2166,He bids me to go and the story tell
2167,"What He ever to you will be,"
2168,"If only you let Him with you abide,"
2169,"Oh, my friend, won't you love Him forever?"
2170,"Accept Him today as your Saviour, this Stranger of Galilee."
2171,彷彿當年在加利利海濱﹐
2172,眼望面前波光鱗鱗﹔
2173,我見岸上群眾簇擁如雲﹐
2174,爭看加利利陌生人﹗
2175,我見祂怎樣醫好瞎眼者﹐
2176,即刻叫他重見光明﹐
2177,又施恩能叫瘸腿者前行﹐

2185,慈愛加利利陌生人﹗
2186,祂向我露出祂手痕、肋傷﹐
2187,"低聲說道﹕""這是為你。"""
2188,我伏祂腳前﹐重擔全脫離-
2189,感激加利利陌生人﹗
2190,我見海上風暴、怒濤洶湧﹐
2191,祂命風浪即刻平靜﹐
2192,聞祂號令﹐海面立時安穩-
2193,全能加利利陌生人﹗
2194,從此我覺無限平靜安寧﹐
2195,心頭奇妙喜樂融融﹔

2200,祂要平息風暴﹐護你安穩-
2201,來依加利利陌生人﹗
2202,祂命我來向你傳達好訊﹔
2203,祂已為你預備福分﹐
2204,惟要你肯謙卑與祂親近-
2205,跟隨加利利陌生人﹗
2206,朋友﹗你是否願永遠愛祂?
2207,因祂那樣溫柔憐憫﹗
2208,今日﹐便認祂為你救主-這加利利陌生人﹗
2209,"There were ninety and nine that safely lay in the shelter of the fold,"

2219,But none of the ransomed ever knew how deep were the waters crossed;

2321,"I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,"
2322,I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
2323,"O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,"
2324,For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
2325,"Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,"
2326,Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand;
2327,"Safe am I within the castle of God's word retreating,"
2328,"Nothing then can reach me, 'tis Beulah Land."
2329,"Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me,"
2330,"I am safely sheltered here, protected by God's hand;"
2331,"Here the sun is always shining, here there's naught can harm me,"
2332,I am safe forever in Beulah Land.
2333,"Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,"
2334,"Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way He planned;"
2335,"Dwelling in the Spirit, here I learn of full salvation,"
2336,Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.
2337,前在埃及為罪奴僕﹐不知何為自由﹔
2338,良心常有罪的重負﹐無處得拯救。
2339,如今屬地事物纏累對我再無關係﹐
2340,無何能使我離榮美之地。
2341,今我登巍巍高山﹐在光天化日之中﹔
2342,今我飲滾滾活泉﹐長年湧流無終﹔
2343,今我得豐富﹐地滿乳蜜﹐路滴脂油﹐
2344,恩重重-樂哉﹗今我居榮美之地。
2345,前在埃及充滿可畏風暴、疑惑打擊﹔
2346,仇敵權勢何其難擋﹐我軟弱無力。
2347,在神話語保壘居住﹐我得平安護庇-
2348,敵蹤消失﹐在此榮美之地。
2349,來罷﹗可畏風暴吹襲﹐我再無所懼畏﹔
2350,在神能手蔭蔽之下﹐我安享護衛。
2351,在此日光經常照耀﹐再無禍害臨及-
2352,平安永久﹐在此榮美之地。
2353,我今四顧神聖作為﹐默念何等甘甜﹔
2354,我見道路都經計劃﹐因聞祂恩言﹔
2355,在此我獲完全救恩﹐因得居聖靈裏﹐
2356,歡樂永久﹐在此榮美之地。
2357,Wonderful grand new song of the Lamb;
2358,Glory to God! Glory to God!
2359,Marvelous news bringing joy to men; glory to God on high!
2360,"Jesus my Lord came down to earth,"
2361,"Leaving His glory us to save,"
2362,"Such wondrous grace beyond compare,"
2363,For sinners as I He cares.
2364,"Shout of His praise, let the heart resound! Glory to God! Glory to God!"
2365,Never the world knew such matchless song! Glory to God on high!
2366,Hark to the rhymes of the heav'nly song;
2367,"Jesus is love, and He is light; glory to God on high!"
2368,All guilty sinners born to die
2369,"Who hopelessly in darkness cry,"
2370,Help from the Lord won't be denied —
2371,"Oh, come and be justified!"
2372,Lift up your voice for the judgement's past;
2373,"Risen with Christ, we with Him are one; glory to God on high!"
2374,"O death and sin, where is thy sting?"
2375,On yonder shore we stand and sing!
2376,See how the Red Sea drowns our foes —
2377,Salvation to us is told!
2378,"Sing, for He's coming to take the saints;"
2379,"He tarries not, for the Church's full grown; glory to God on high!"
2380,"What we've long pined for now's in sight,"
2381,All yearning hearts are satisfied;
2382,"Whispers of love we'll ever breathe,"
2383,One future with Him we share!
2384,"Sing o'er and o'er, make a joyful noise;"
2385,"Ring out this theme, sing forevermore; glory to God on high!"
2386,"Sing, till the heart beats high with joy;"

2389,"All new creatures, lift your voice!"
2390,美哉、善哉﹐羔羊的新歌﹔
2391,榮耀歸主﹗榮耀歸主﹗
2392,這個福音賜無比快樂﹐榮耀至高的主﹗
2393,耶穌基督降生下土﹐
2394,離去尊榮是為救贖﹐
2395,如此奇恩舉世皆無﹐
2396,愚人也會感驚愕。
2397,大聲讚美﹐口唱連心和﹐榮耀歸主﹗榮耀歸主﹗
2398,自古以來無此詩歌﹐榮耀至高的主﹗
2399,聽哪﹐歌聲由天飄揚來﹐
2400,祂就是光﹐祂也就是愛﹐榮耀至高的主﹗
2401,世界所有悲傷淚人﹐
2402,地上一切不安罪人﹐
2403,完全不管你是誰人﹐
2404,耶穌都已為還債。
2405,應當高歌﹐因審判已過﹐
2406,與主聯合﹐我們已復活﹐榮耀至高的主﹗
2407,我們已在墳墓那邊﹐
2408,立在死亡不到地點﹐
2409,仇敵浮沉紅海中間﹐
2410,主賜稱義的把握。
2411,唱哪﹐祂再降臨接聖徒﹐
2412,不再耽延﹐教會已成熟﹐榮耀至高的主﹗
2413,今能看見前所求呼﹐
2414,也能領受久所羨慕﹐
2415,永能傾吐此心情愫﹐
2416,與祂只有一前途。
2417,此歌再唱聲音應明朗﹐
2418,此歌題目應當一直唱﹐榮耀至高的主﹗
2419,唱至內心歡喜會跳﹐
2420,唱至天下佈滿此調﹐
2421,唱至所有蒙愛新造﹐
2422,都唱此歌不肯放。
2451,For me the Lord was crucified;
2452,In agony and blood He died.
2453,On Calvary His body torn:
2454,The ransom paid for sins of mine.
2455,主是為我釘十字架﹐
2456,為我受苦流血捨命﹔
2457,主代替我在十字架﹐
2458,擔當一切罪惡疾病。
2459,"The spacious firmament on high, with all the blue ethereal sky,"
2460,"And spangled heav'ns, a shining frame, their great Original proclaim."
2461,"Th'unwearied sun, from day to day, does his Creator's pow'r display;"
2462,And publishes to every land the work of an almighty hand.
2463,"Soon as the evening shades prevail, the moon takes up the wondrous tale;"
2464,And nightly to the listening earth repeats the story of her birth;
2465,"While all the stars that round her burn, and all the planets in their turn,"
2466,"Confirm the tidings as they roll, and spread the truth from pole to pole."
2467,What though in solemn silence all move round the dark terrestrial ball?
2468,What though no real voice nor sound amid the radiant orbs be found?
2469,"In reason's ear they all rejoice, and utter forth a glorious voice,"
2470,"Forever singing as they shine, ""The hand that made us is divine."""
2471,仰看穹蒼﹐浩大無窮﹐蔚藍、深邃﹐沒有止境﹔
2472,其中千萬星光閃爍﹐共同宣告神的創作。
2473,不息太陽日日奔馳﹐將主創造大能顯示﹐
2474,普照天下一切受造﹐說明全能手段奇妙。
2475,夕陽西下﹐夜色來襲﹐明月溫柔靜照大地﹔
2476,長夜漫漫﹐一再自述﹕當初主怎將它造出。
2477,四圍星辰發光如熾﹐一一述說自己故事﹐
2478,一面運行﹐一面傳揚﹐信息傳遍地極、四方。
2479,雖然星辰奔馳夜空﹐莊嚴靜默﹐來復運行﹔
2480,僅依軌道發出光明﹐無言無語﹐無聲可聽﹔
2481,但在智者耳中常聞它們發出榮耀聲音﹐
2482,"一面照耀﹐一面稱頌﹕""造我的手何其神聖﹗"""
2483,"My God, how wonderful Thou art,"
2484,"Thy majesty how bright,"
2485,"How beautiful Thy mercy seat,"
2486,In depths of burning light!
2487,"How dread are Thine eternal years,"
2488,O everlasting Lord:
2489,"By prostrate spirits day and night,"
2490,Incessantly adored!
2491,"O how I fear Thee, living God,"
2492,"With deepest, tend'rest fears,"
2493,"And worship Thee with trembling hope,"
2494,And penitential tears!
2495,"Yet I may love Thee too, O Lord,"
2496,"Almighty as Thou art,"
2497,For Thou has stooped to ask of me
2498,The love of my poor heart!
2499,"No earthly father loves like Thee,"
2500,"No mother, e'er so mild,"
2501,Bears and forbears as Thou hast done
2502,"With me, Thy sinful child."
2503,"How wonderful, how beautiful,"

2507,神阿﹐祢是何等奇妙﹗
2508,何等威嚴莊重﹗
2509,施恩寶座純潔明耀﹐
2510,無限明光之中。
2511,永遠的神﹐何等尊貴﹐
2512,諸天是祢座位﹔
2513,祢前﹐眾靈晝夜環跪﹐
2514,不停﹐不住讚美。
2515,哦﹐神﹐我是何等畏祢﹐
2516,柔細深切敬畏﹔
2517,歡樂羨慕我來親祢﹐
2518,並懊悔著流淚。
2519,哦﹐主﹐但我也可愛祢﹐
2520,雖然祢是主宰﹔
2521,因祢降卑向我示意﹐
2522,要這不值的愛。
2523,地上無父如此慈愛﹐
2524,無母如此仁慈﹐
2525,像祢這樣背負祢忍耐
2526,祢的軟弱孩子。
2527,何等奇妙﹐當我見祢﹗
2528,在那聖潔光中﹔
2529,無邊智慧﹐無限能力﹐
2530,和祢榮耀無窮。
2531,"Love Divine, all loves excelling, joy of heav'n, to earth come down;"
2532,"Fix in us Thy humble dwelling, all Thy faithful mercies crown."
2533,"Jesus, Thou art all compassion; pure, unbounded love Thou art;"
2534,"Visit us with Thy salvation, enter ev'ry trembling heart."
2535,"Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit into every troubled breast;"

2544,Let us see Thy great salvation perfectly restored in Thee;
2545,"Changed from glory into glory till with Thee we take our place,"
2546,"Till we cast our crowns before Thee, lost in wonder, love and praise."
2547,神聖之愛﹐遠超眾愛﹐天上之樂臨地上﹔
2548,竟來住我卑微胸懷﹐作我相信的恩賞。
2549,恩主﹐祢是所有憐憫﹐祢是純潔無限愛﹔
2550,眷顧我們﹐帶來救恩﹐進入相信的胸懷。
2551,哦﹐主﹐向我吹祢聖靈﹐吹進煩擾的心裡﹔
2552,使我有分祢的豐盛﹐享受應許的安息。
2553,使我除去罪的愛好﹐除去一切的捆綁﹔
2554,使我認識生命之道﹐使我完全得釋放。
2555,大能的主﹐前來拯救﹐賜我生命何豐盛﹔
2556,願祢同在直到永久﹐永遠住在祢殿中。
2557,我要時常頌讚祢名﹐照祢喜悅事奉祢﹔
2558,不住禱告﹐不住頌稱﹐誇耀祢愛永無已。
2559,求祢完成祢的新造﹐使我純潔無瑕疵﹔
2560,祢大救恩我全享到﹐得以和祢全相似。
2561,更新變化﹐榮上加榮﹐直到滿有祢身量﹔
2562,直到進入榮耀之中﹐永遠將祢愛頌揚。
2563,"I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever,"
2564,"I will sing, I will sing."
2565,I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
2566,"With my mouth will I make known Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness,"
2567,With my mouth will I make known Thy faithfulness to all generations.
2568,"我要唱耶和華的大慈愛到永遠,"
2569,"我要唱,我要唱;"
2570,我要唱耶和華的大慈愛。
2571,"用我口,叫人知道祢大信實,祢大信實;"
2572,"用我口,叫人知道祢大信實直到萬世萬代。"
2573,"Why should I worry, doubt and fear?"
2574,Has God not caused His son to bear my sins upon the tree?
2575,"The debt that Christ for me has paid,"
2576,"Would God demand it be repaid, and claim again from me?"
2577,"Redemption full the Lord has made,"
2578,"And all my debts has fully paid, from law to set me free."
2579,"I fear not for the wrath of God,"
2580,"For I've been sprinkled with His blood, it wholly covers me."
2581,"For me forgivenness He has gained,"
2582,"And full acquittal was obtained, all debts of sin are paid;"
2583,"God would not have His claim on two,"
2584,"First on His Son, my Surety true, and then upon me laid."
2585,"So now I have full peace and rest,"
2586,My Saviour Christ hath done the best and set me wholly free;
2587,By His all-efficacious blood
2588,"I ne'er could be condemned by God, for He has died for me!"
2589,我為甚麼憂懼疑惑﹖
2590,神豈未曾將我罪過歸祂兒子身上﹖
2591,主所為我還清的債﹐
2592,公義的神能否再來要我重新清償﹖
2593,祢的救贖永遠完全﹐
2594,祢已還清每一文錢—我們所有罪戾﹔
2595,神的忿怒不能威脅﹐
2596,因我已經灑上寶血﹐靠恩已經稱義。
2597,祢既為我領得赦免﹐
2598,祢既給我白白恩典—罪債一起清算﹔
2599,神就不會兩面討償﹕
2600,先在我的中保身上﹐又來要我歸還。
2601,所以我心﹐你當安息﹐
2602,你的救主所有功績﹐已使你得開釋﹔
2603,當信祂的有效寶血﹐
2604,不怕神再將你棄絕﹐因主已為你死。
2605,"We hear the words of love,"
2606,"We gaze upon the blood,"
2607,"We see the mighty sacrifice,"
2608,And we have peace with God.
2609,'Tis everlasting peace!
2610,Sure as Jehovah's name;
2611,"'Tis stable as His steadfast throne,"
2612,For evermore the same.
2613,"Our love is ofttimes low,"
2614,Our joy still ebbs and flows;
2615,"But peace with Him remains the same,"
2616,No change Jehovah knows.
2617,We change — He changes not;
2618,Our Christ can never die:
2619,"His love, not ours, the resting-place,"
2620,We on Him truth rely.
2621,"The cross still stands unchanged,"
2622,Though heaven is now His home;
2623,"The mighty stone is rolled away,"
2624,But yonder is His tomb!
2625,"And yonder is our peace,"
2626,The grave of all our woes;
2627,"We know the Song of God has come,"
2628,We know He died and rose.
2629,We know He liveth now
2630,At God's right hand above;
2631,We know the throne on which He sits
2632,We know His truth and love!
2633,我們聽見慈愛之聲﹐
2634,我們注視奇妙寶血﹐
2635,我們看見偉大祭牲﹐
2636,就得與神相安和諧。
2637,這個平安歷久不變﹐
2638,像主聖名一樣穩固﹐
2639,像主寶座一樣貞堅﹐
2640,直到永遠一樣滿足。
2641,我們愛心時常冷淡﹐
2642,我們喜樂也常沉升﹔
2643,但這平安總不衰殘﹐
2644,因耶和華永不變更。
2645,我們雖變﹐祂仍不變﹐
2646,祂是基督﹐永遠存活﹔
2647,我們安息在祂愛間﹐
2648,靠祂信實﹐永得穩妥。
2649,雖然祂已在天安宅﹐
2650,但祂十架屹立不變﹔
2651,雖然大石已被挪開﹐
2652,但祂墳墓仍在那邊。
2653,我們平安就在那邊﹐
2654,因為禍患都進墳墓﹔
2655,我們知道神子受遣﹐
2656,知道祂曾死而復甦。
2657,我們知道祂今活著﹐
2658,知道祂在父神右邊﹔
2659,我們認識祂的寶座﹐
2660,認識祂的誠實愛憐。
2661,"To God be the glory, great things He hath done,"
2662,"So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,"
2663,"Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,"
2664,And opened the Life-gate that all may go in.
2665,"Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice!"
2666,"Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice!"
2667,"Oh come to the Father, thro' Jesus the Son,"
2668,"And give Him the glory, great things He hath done."
2669,"O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,"
2670,To ev'ry believer the promise of God;
2671,"The vilest offender who truly believes,"
2672,That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.
2673,"Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,"
2674,And great our rejoicing thro' Jesus the Son;
2677,這個真是何等甘美的故事﹐
2678,神用無限的愛差遣祂兒子﹐
2679,來自天上榮耀﹐死於十字架﹐
2680,成功救贖﹐好使我們進神家。
2681,讚美祂﹗讚美祂﹗工作已經成功﹗
2682,感謝祂﹗感謝祂﹗恩典真寬宏﹗
2683,我們榮耀耶穌﹐我們的救主﹐
2684,我們歌唱耶穌﹐永遠不止住。
2685,這個真是何等奇妙的故事﹐
2686,寶座要求﹐因著寶血就停止﹐
2687,公義審判﹐竟被神兒子擔負﹐
2688,因此神就心滿﹐罪人也意足。
2689,基督已登寶座﹐榮耀何光輝﹗
2690,耶穌已被高舉﹐名字何尊貴﹗
2691,是的﹐我們救主﹐得華冠的主﹐
2692,配得所有聖徒永遠的稱祝。
2693,Unto the hills around do I lift up my longing eyes;
2694,"O whence for me shall my salvation come, from whence arise?"
2695,"From God the Lord doth come my certain aid,"
2696,From God the Lord who heav'n and earth hath made.
2697,He will not suffer that thy foot be moved: safe shalt thou be.
2698,"No careless slumber shall His eyelids close, who keepeth thee."
2699,"Behold our God the Lord, He slumbereth ne'er,"
2700,Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.
2701,"Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true, Thy changeless shade;"
2702,Jehovah thy defense on thy right hand Himself hath made.
2703,And thee no sun by day shall ever smite;
2704,No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.
2705,"From every evil shall He keep thy soul, from every sin;"
2706,"Jehovah shall preserve thy going out, Thy coming in."
2707,"Above thee watching, He whom we adore"
2708,"Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, forevermore."
2709,我要抬頭﹐向眾山嶺舉目﹐切切仰望﹕
2710,我的幫助﹐我切需的幫助﹐來自何方﹖
2711,我的幫助從耶和華而來﹔
2712,祂曾創造諸天、大地、洋海。
2713,祂必不叫你的腳步動搖﹐你可安穩﹗
2714,保護你的不打盹﹐不睡覺﹐你可安心﹗
2715,看哪﹗那保護以色列的神﹐
2716,祂不睡覺﹐祂永遠不打盹。
2717,主耶和華親作你的護庇﹐信實不變﹗
2718,主耶和華親作你的蔭蔽﹐站你右邊﹗
2719,白日太陽必不將你灼傷﹐
2720,夜間月亮必不叫你遭殃。
2721,祂保守你免受一切災害﹐平安無恙﹗
2722,你出﹐你入﹐祂都保護無駭﹐在上守望﹗
2723,可頌之神﹐我讚美祢恩典﹐
2724,因祢保守從今時到永遠。
2725,Eternal Light! Eternal Light!
2726,How pure the soul must be!
2727,"When placed within Thy searching sight,"
2728,"It shrinks not, but with calm delight"
2729,Can live and look on Thee.
2730,The spirits that surround Thy throne
2731,May bear the burning bliss;
2732,"But that is surely theirs alone,"
2733,"Since thy have never, never known"
2734,A fallen world like this.
2735,"Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere"
2736,"Is dark, whose mind is dim,"
2737,"Before th' Ineffable appear,"
2738,And on my natural spirit bear
2739,The uncreated beam?
2740,There is a way for man to rise
2741,"To Thee, sublime abode;"
2742,"An offering and a sacrifice,"
2743,"A Holy Spirit's energies,"
2744,An Advocate with God.
2745,"These, these prepare us for the sight"
2746,Of holiness above;
2747,The sons of ignorance and night
2748,"May dwell in the eternal Light,"
2749,Through the eternal Love.
2750,永遠的光﹐永遠的光﹐
2751,何等榮耀輝煌﹗
2752,我不純潔﹐何能經祢
2753,探照之光﹐平安不慌﹐
2754,並不戰競滅亡﹗
2755,天上眾靈圍繞寶座﹐
2756,得沐聖潔光芒﹔
2757,只有他們不會自責﹐
2758,因為他們從未認識﹐
2759,經歷墮落境界。
2760,我們天賦情況黑暗﹐
2761,我們思維虛妄﹔
2762,"""自有永有""我心可瞻﹐"
2763,赤裸的我何能擔當
2764,祢這永遠的光﹗
2765,今有一路為我開闢﹐
2766,直達最高天上﹔
2767,一個犧牲﹐一次獻祭﹐
2768,一位聖靈所有能力﹐
2769,一位新約中保。
2770,這使我們能以注視﹐
2771,天上聖潔無礙﹔
2772,無知之民﹐黑夜之子﹐
2773,能以住於永遠的光﹐
2774,因有永遠的愛。
2775,"The God of Abraham praise, who reigns enthroned above;"
2776,"Ancient of everlasting days, and God of love."
2777,"Jehovah, great I Am, by earth and heav'n confessed;"

2779,The God of Abraham praise at whose supreme command
2780,"From earth I rise, and seek the joys at His right hand:"
2781,"I all on earth forsake, its wisdom, fame, and power;"
2782,"And Him my only portion make, my shield and tower."
2783,The God of Abraham praise! Whose all-sufficient grace
2784,Shall guide me all my happy days in all my ways:
2785,He calls a worm His friend! He calls Himself my God!
2786,And He shall save me to the end through Jesus' blood!
2787,"He by Himself hath sworn, I on His oath depend;"
2788,"I shall on eagles' wings upborne, to heaven ascend;"

2799,亞伯拉罕的神﹗遵照祂的旨意﹐
2800,我已決心離家而奔﹐往尋福地﹕
2801,撇棄吾珥一切﹐權勢、名聲、私財﹔
2802,惟求神作我的產業﹐堡壘、盾牌。
2803,亞伯拉罕的神﹗我能完全信託﹔
2804,祂無限愛﹐祂夠用恩一路領我。
2805,祂稱微蟲為友﹐自認祂是我神﹔
2806,藉主寶血﹐祂施拯救﹐永施大恩。
2807,祂指自己起誓﹐所許決不落空﹔
2808,我將附於飛鷹雙翅﹐直升天空﹔

2855,"Hark! the glad sound, the Saviour comes!"
2856,The Saviour promised long;
2857,"Let every heart prepare a throne,"
2858,And every voice a song.
2859,He comes the prisoners to release
2860,In Satan's bondage held;

2969,"Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy Kingly crown,"
2970,When Thou camest to earth for me;
2971,But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room
2972,For Thy holy nativity.
2973,"Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!"
2974,There is room in my heart for Thee;
2975,"Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,"
2976,There is room in my heart for Thee.
2977,"Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,"
2978,Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
2979,"But of lowly birth didst Thou come to earth,"
2980,And in great humility.
2981,"The foxes found rest, and the birds their nest"
2982,In the shade of the forest tree;
2983,"But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,"
2984,In the deserts of Galilee.
2985,"Thou camest, O Lord, with the living Word"
2986,That should set Thy people free;
2987,"But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,"
2988,They bore Thee to Calvary.
2989,Thy cross is my only plea;
2990,Thy cross is my only plea.

2996,When Thou comest and callest for me;
2997,離棄寶座﹐撇下王冕﹐
2998,祢降塵世救罪奴﹔
2999,但伯利恒並無房間
3000,可作祢的出生處。
3001,哦﹐來我心中﹐主耶穌﹗
3002,在我心有空處為祢﹔
3003,哦﹐來我心中﹐主耶穌﹐來﹗
3004,在我心有空處為祢。
3005,滿天榮耀﹐天使宣告﹕
3006,祢是君王至尊貴﹔
3007,豈知神子竟生馬槽﹐
3008,又是貧寒又謙卑。
3009,狐狸有洞﹐飛鳥有窩﹐
3010,山林、高空可優游﹔
3011,但祢神子勞碌奔波﹐
3012,在地何處可枕首﹖
3013,主﹐祢帶來生命之道﹐
3014,拯救罪人離死亡﹔
3015,但人給祢荊冕紫袍﹐
3016,把祢釘在十架上。
3017,哦﹐來我心中﹐主耶穌﹐
3018,祢十架﹐我惟一憑依﹔
3019,祢十架是我的憑依。
3020,滿天榮耀﹐天使呼叫﹐
3021,當祢得勝奏凱回﹐
3022,讓我聽祢慈聲說道﹕
3023,"""我有空處為你備""。"
3024,哦﹐我心歡喜﹐主耶穌﹐

3026,哦﹐願祢快來﹐主耶穌﹐來﹗
3027,願祢來提接我回家。
3028,"My Lord has garments so wondrous fine, and myrrh their texture fills;"
3029,"Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine, with joy my being thrills."
3030,"Out of the ivory palaces, into a world of woe."
3031,"Only His great, eternal love made my Saviour go."
3032,"His life had also its sorrows sore, for aloes had a part;"
3033,"And when I think of the cross He bore, my eyes with teardrops start."
3034,"His garments too were in cassia dipped, with healing in a touch;"
3035,"Each time my feet in some sin have slipped, He took me from its clutch."
3036,我主衣袍是何等華美﹐飄逸沒藥馨香﹔
3037,如此馨香竟沁我心內﹐使我喜樂蕩漾。
3038,華美天庭—祂甘願離開﹐到此痛苦世間﹔
3039,乃是祂的永遠大愛﹐使祂一路往前。
3040,我主在世曾憂患備嘗﹐猶如搗碎沉香﹔
3041,每當思念祂十架難當﹐我眼不禁淚淌。
3042,我主衣袍為肉桂薰透﹔一摸立得醫治﹔
3043,當我絆倒﹐祂即施援手﹐使我脫離罪勢。
3044,耶穌我主榮耀王﹐你愛何等寬廣—
3045,甘離寶座親來世界尋迷羊﹕
3046,你生馬槽謙卑樣﹐又向埃及逃亡﹔
3047,回加利利﹐居拿撒勒﹐歷風霜﹔
3048,三十三載役於人﹐藐視、厭棄難當﹔
3049,廣傳福音﹐報告禧年﹐走四方﹔
3050,殷勤服事忍饑腸﹐困乏休息無床。
3051,美哉﹐善哉﹐主愛奇哉﹐深且長﹗
3052,耶穌我主救世王﹐你愛感我衷腸—
3053,客西馬尼備極傷痛﹐意倉惶﹕
3054,汗如血點滴地上﹐順從父旨不忘﹔
3055,捨身救世﹐面如堅石前行壯﹔
3056,輕看羞辱和苦難﹐忍受罪人頂撞﹔
3057,背負十架﹐往各各他﹐不延宕﹔
3058,手足被釘肋受傷﹐血水流出命喪。
3059,耶穌我主得勝王﹐你愛何等無量—
3060,十架祈禱﹐憐憫為懷﹐心何廣﹗
3061,同釘一賊得生望﹐可知救恩無疆﹔
3062,身負重罪﹐為神離棄﹐倍淒涼﹔
3063,痛徹肺腑心焦渴﹐苦膽、酸醋親嘗﹔
3064,救贖功成﹐將靈交神﹐打勝仗﹔
3065,由死復活升天上﹐代禱猶如馨香。
3066,耶穌我主平安王﹐你愛豈能測量—
3067,我猶罪人﹐你已代死﹐愛明彰﹕
3068,洗我罪孽醫我傷﹐安慰憐恤多方﹔
3069,責備管教﹐定我步履﹐賜我光﹔
3070,敵雖兇惡不足懼﹐救恩為我城牆﹔
3071,疲乏軟弱﹐你加我力﹐使剛強。
3072,仰望我主在天上﹐心被恩感歌唱﹕
3073,It was alone the Saviour prayed in dark Gethsemane;
3074,"Alone He drained the bitter cup, and suffered there for me."
3075,"Alone, alone, He bore it all alone;"
3076,"He gave Himself to save His own,"
3077,"He suffered, bled and died alone, alone."
3078,It was alone the Saviour stood in Pilate's judgment hall;
3079,"Alone the crown of thorns He wore, forsaken thus by all."
3080,Alone upon the cross He hung that others He might save;
3081,"Forsaken then by God and man, alone, His life He gave."
3082,Can you reject such matchless love? Can you His claim disown?
3083,"Come, give your all in gratitude, nor leave Him thus alone."
3084,耶穌獨自為我祈禱﹐在那客西馬尼﹔
3085,極其傷痛﹐大聲哀告﹐汗流猶如血滴。
3086,為我﹗為我﹗為我祂釘十架﹐
3087,捨命流血作我贖價﹔
3088,祂心如蠟鎔化﹐為我﹗為我﹗
3089,耶穌獨自為我被捆﹐在祂被賣晚間﹔
3090,獨自為我受誣受審﹐在彼拉多面前。
3091,耶穌獨自為我喝盡忿怒、咒詛苦杯﹐
3092,好使我能得蒙憐憫﹐永遠不嘗死味。
3093,"聽祂臨死喊說﹕""成了﹗""你心能無感慨﹖"
3094,切莫硬把感動打消—不理祂這大愛﹗
3095,"O solemn hour! O hour alone, in solitary night,"
3096,"When God the Father's only Son,"
3097,"As Man, for sinners lost, undone, expires, amazing sight!"
3098,The Lord of glory crucified!
3099,The Lord of Life has bled and died.
3100,"O mystery of mysteries, of life and death the tree!"
3101,"Center of two eternities,"
3102,"Which look with rapt, adoring eyes, onward, and back to Thee!"
3103,"O cross of Christ, where all His pain"
3104,And death is our eternal gain.
3105,"O how our inmost hearts do move, while gazing on that cross!"
3106,The death of the incarnate Love!
3107,"What shame, what grief, what joy we prove, that He should die for us!"
3108,"Our hearts were broken by that cry,"
3109,"""Eli, lama sabachthani!"""
3110,"Worthy of death, O Lord, we were; that vengeance was our due;"
3111,"In grace Thou, spotless Lamb, didst bear"
3112,"Thyself our sins, and guilt, and fear; justice our Surety slew."
3113,"With Thee, our Surety, we have died;"
3114,"With Thee, we there were crucified."
3115,"Quickened with Thee with life divine, raised with Thee from the dead;"
3116,"Thine Own, now human and divine,"
3117,"Shall with Thee in Thy glories shine, the Church's living Head!"
3118,"We, who were worthy but to die,"
3119,"Now with Thee, ""Abba Father,"" cry."
3120,此時何時﹗孤單之時﹗四圍都是黑暗﹗
3121,天上神的獨生之子﹐
3122,以人血肉代人受死﹐這是何等悲慘﹗
3123,榮耀的主釘十字架﹗
3124,生命的王受人傾軋﹗
3125,哦﹐這樣的神、人﹐生、死﹐真是奇中之奇﹗
3126,這是中心﹗兩個永世
3127,莫不舉目而顧、而視你這當受讚的﹗
3128,哦﹐主耶穌﹐你十字架
3129,乃是我的永遠美家﹗
3130,哦﹐當我們看那木頭﹐心中何等感動﹔
3131,愛的化身死在髑髏﹗
3132,哦﹐怎能不又喜又愁﹐看你這樣苦痛﹗
3133,我們心裂聽你呼祈﹕
3134,"""以利﹐拉馬撒巴大尼﹗"""
3135,哦﹐神﹐我們真是該死﹐該受你的忿怒﹔
3136,但你施恩﹐使你愛子
3137,為我受苦、擔罪、忍恥﹐公義殺我救主﹔
3138,我已與祂同被釘釘﹐
3139,我已與祂在彼喪命。
3140,我們與祂一同得生﹐與祂從死同甦﹔
3141,因祂是頭﹐我們是身﹐
3142,我們同祂都是屬神﹐一同蒙神賜福﹔
3143,我們原來只配受罰﹐
3144,今卻同祂呼喊阿爸。
3145,"There is a green hill far away, outside a city wall,"
3146,"Where the dear Lord was crucified, who died to save us all."
3147,"O dearly, dearly has He loved, and we must love Him too;"
3148,"And trust in His redeeming blood, and try His works to do."
3149,"We may not know, we cannot tell what pains He had to bear;"
3150,But we believe it was for us He hung and suffered there.
3151,"He died that we might be forgiv'n, He died to make us good,"
3152,"That we might go at last to heav'n, saved by His precious blood."
3153,There was no other good enough to pay the price of sin;
3154,He only could unlock the gate of heav'n and let us in.
3155,遠山迢迢﹐其色青青﹐在一古城之旁﹔
3156,親愛的主在彼被釘﹐為救我們而亡。
3157,祂既愛我這麼親切﹐我當親切愛祂﹔
3158,傳揚祂的救贖寶血﹐繼續祂的生涯。
3159,誰能知曉﹐誰能盡述﹐祂受苦有多深﹗
3160,但我相信祂受的苦﹐全為我這罪人。
3161,祂死﹐使我罪得饒恕﹔祂死﹐使我得潔﹔
3162,使我至終得進天府﹐靠著祂的寶血。
3163,除祂之外﹐再無甚麼足以清償人罪﹗
3164,惟祂能開天門的鎖﹐並且引我進內。
3165,"O teach me what it meaneth: that Cross uplifted high,"
3166,"With One, the Man of Sorrows, condemned to bleed and die."
3167,O teach me what it cost Thee to make a sinner whole;
3168,"And teach me, Saviour, teach me the value of a soul."
3169,"O teach me what it meaneth: that sacred crimson tide,"
3170,The blood and water flowing from Thine own wounded side.
3171,"Teach me that if none other had sinned, but I alone,"
3172,"Yet still, Thy blood, O Jesus, Thine only, must atone."
3173,"O teach me what it meaneth: Thy love beyond compare,"
3174,The love that reacheth deeper than depths of self-despair!
3175,"Yea, teach me, till there gloweth in this cold heart of mine,"
3176,"Some feeble, pale reflection of that pure love of Thine."
3177,"O teach me what it meaneth, for I am full of sin:"
3178,"And grace alone can reach me, and love alone can win."
3179,"O teach me, for I need Thee, I have no hope beside,"
3180,The chief of all the sinners for whom the Saviour died.
3181,"O infinite Redeemer, I bring no other plea;"
3182,Because Thou dost invite me I cast myself on Thee.
3183,Because Thou dost accept me I love and I adore;
3184,"Because Thy love constraineth, I'll praise Thee evermore."
3185,哦﹐主﹐求祢指教我﹐為何十架高立﹐
3186,"""憂患之子""在掛著﹐手足被釘絕氣﹖"
3187,教我有何能值得祢來為我受死﹖
3188,究竟我能值幾何﹖我有甚麼價值﹖
3189,哦﹐主﹐求祢指教我﹐為何並且為誰
3190,祢的肋旁被扎破﹐流出寶血和水﹖
3191,教我﹐如果無別人犯罪需祢救贖﹐
3192,只是為著我一魂﹐祢血仍須流出。
3193,哦﹐主﹐求祢指教我﹐祢愛闊長深高﹔
3194,我若愚痴才測度﹐長闊誰能知道﹗
3195,教我﹐直到祢這愛將我硬心鎔化﹐
3196,直到我心滿感戴﹐我眼淚如雨下。
3197,哦﹐主﹐求祢指教我﹐我是何等罪魁﹗
3198,性情何惡﹐罪何多﹐心地何等昏昧﹗
3199,教我﹐惟祢肯愛我﹐惟祢能救失喪﹔
3200,能赦我罪免我禍﹐無祢﹐我必滅亡。
3201,哦﹐祢是我救贖主﹐我心因祢安息﹔
3202,因祢曾將我救贖﹐我今完全歸祢。
3203,哦﹐祢竟不將我棄﹐這是甚麼愛呢﹖
3204,因祢這愛的希奇﹐我要永遠愛祢。

3255,"O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head! Our Lord was laid on Thee;"
3256,"Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead, didst bear all ill for me."
3257,A victim let; Thy blood was shed; Now there's no load for me.
3258,"Death and the curse were in our cup, O Christ, 'twas full for Thee!"
3259,But Thou hast drained the last dark drop — 'Tis empty now for me.
3260,That bitter cup — love drank it up; Now blessings' draught for me.
3261,"Jehovah lifted up His rod, O Christ, it fell on Thee!"
3262,Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God; there's not one stroke for me.
3263,"Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed; Thy bruising healeth me."
3264,"The tempest's awful voice was heard, O Christ, it broke on Thee!"
3265,"Thy open bosom was my ward, it braved the storm for me."
3266,"Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred; Now cloudless peace for me."
3267,"For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died, and I have died in Thee;"
3268,"Thou'rt ris'n: my bands are all untied, and now Thou liv'st in me."
3269,"When purified, made white, and tried, Thy glory then for me!"
3270,哦﹐主﹐甚麼使你頭垂﹖我罪壓你身上﹗
3271,你是站在罪人地位﹐將我罪孽擔當﹔
3272,作我祭牲﹐流血贖罪﹐使我得著釋放。
3273,死亡、咒詛﹐本是我杯﹐竟然滿盈為你﹔
3274,親嘗苦汁﹐滴滴死味﹐如今空杯傳遞﹔
3275,是愛催促飲竭這杯﹐留下福杯滿溢。
3276,公義父神舉起刑杖﹐竟是向你打下﹗
3277,你被父神苦待、擊傷﹐使我免受刑罰﹔
3278,渾身傷痕﹐血﹐水流淌﹐作我醫治代價。
3279,遍地黑暗﹐怒聲可聞﹐竟是向你摧擊﹔
3280,你的胸懷讓我藏身﹐成我安息之境﹔
3281,你身、你面受創毀損﹐我得平安歡欣。
3282,哦﹐主﹐你曾為我命喪﹐你死我也有分﹔
3283,但你復活將我釋放﹐如今活在我心﹔
3284,經過熬煉﹐純潔白淨﹐榮耀之境得進。

3320,My Saviour came to Calvary:
3321,"The Lamb of God, spotless and pure,"
3322,Offered Himself a sacrifice.
3323,"O Jesus Lord, my dearest Saviour,"
3324,Thy love doth captivate my heart;
3325,To Thee I give my with'ring life
3326,The Father's heart to satisfy!
3327,And now through God's eternal Spirit
3328,"I'm brought to awesome Calvary,"
3329,Where I behold His matchless love
3330,In dying for a worm like me.
3331,On Calvary's brow vict'ry is won —
3332,New hope for fallen race appears;
3333,"Turning the page of curse and woe,"
3334,Thou hast all things in Thee renewed.
3335,"His cry so solemn, ""It is finished!"""
3336,Doth rouse the heav'n with rapt'rous praise.
3337,Thy death hast freed me from Death's power.
3338,Thy life hast given life to me.
3339,What wondrous grace revealed at Calv'ry!
3340,"Cleansed is my conscience in Thy blood,"
3341,That I might all my dead works conquer
3342,"Ever to serve my Lord, my God."
3343,"O Thou my Soul, how can it be"
3344,That thou shouldst speak forth all His grace.
3345,My heart is lost in heav'nly sweetness.
3346,My eyes stream forth unceasing tears.

3403,"My faith looks up to Thee, thou Lamb of Calvary,"
3404,Saviour Divine;
3405,Now hear me while I pray; take all my guilt away;
3406,"Oh, let me from this day be wholly Thine."

3418,"Oh, bear me safe above, a ransomed soul."
3419,我以信心仰望祢在十字架上﹐
3420,我的救主﹗
3421,求祢聽我禱告﹐將我罪過寬饒﹐
3422,使我從今到老—全屬基督﹗
3423,主﹐賜能力恩惠﹐在這軟弱心內—
3424,熱情鼓舞﹗
3425,祢既為我流血﹐我要愛祢深切、
3426,真摯、長久、純潔—如火如荼。
3427,我今行走世路﹐不時遇見憂苦﹔
3428,求祢引領﹗
3429,擦乾我的眼淚﹐保守我不懊悔﹐
3430,拯救我不犯罪—榮耀祢名。
3431,人生短夢一過﹐死河要起寒波﹐
3432,將我淹沒﹔
3433,那時求主恩惠﹐除我疑惑驚畏﹐
3434,帶我平安而歸—永遠快樂。
3435,O 'twas wondrous love the Saviour show'd for me!
3436,"When He left His throne for Calvary,"
3437,"When He bore my trespass, bore it all alone;"
3438,"Praise His name forever, make it known."
3439,"All the way to Calvary He went for me,"
3440,"He went for me, He went for me."
3441,He died to set me free.
3442,"Oh, how dark the night that wrapt my spirit round!"
3443,"Oh, how deep the woe my Saviour found,"
3444,"When He walked across the waters of my soul,"
3445,Bade my night disperse and made me whole!
3446,"Tremblingly a sinner bowed before His face,"
3447,"Naught I knew of pardon, God's free grace;"
3448,"Heard a voice so melting, ""Cease thy wild regret,"
3449,"Jesus bought thy pardon, paid thy debt."""
3450,哦﹐愛﹗奇妙之愛﹐救主去加略﹗
3451,為去那地﹐祂竟離寶座﹐
3452,來受貧窮、苦楚，遭患從未卻；
3453,一路艱難全是為著我﹗
3454,祂去加略﹐一路全是為著我﹐
3455,是為著我﹐是為著我；
3456,祂去將我救活﹗
3457,阿呀﹗遍地黑暗﹐神來審判祂﹗
3458,聖潔怒氣焚燒如烈火；
3459,因祂替我擔罪﹐公義將祂殺﹐
3460,祂受刑罰﹐乃是代替我﹗
3461,祂在十架受死﹐乃是代替我﹐
3462,是代替我﹐是代替我；

3468,祂在十架流血﹐已經救贖我﹐
3469,已救贖我﹐已救贖我；
3470,流血免我災禍﹗
3471,'Neath the cross of my Saviour I ponder:
3472,Why should Jesus bear such agony?
3473,"Here the pure Lamb of God gave His own life,"
3474,That I might from my sins be set free.
3475,"Lord, for me, Thou hast all Yours forsaken,"
3476,How can I shun Thy great love once more?
3477,"I believe, I receive Thee, Lord Jesus,"
3478,And to Thee yield my life and my all.
3479,十架下我低頭靜默思想﹕
3480,主耶穌為何故受苦害﹖
3481,無瑕疵﹐無斑點﹐神的羔羊﹐
3482,為了我捨性命償罪債。
3483,哦﹐恩主﹐祢為我撇下所有﹐
3484,奇妙愛我怎能再輕棄﹖
3485,我惟有從今後相信接受﹐
3486,獻全身並全心歸給祢。
3498,"I am coming to the cross; I am poor, and weak, and blind;"
3499,I am counting all but dross; I shall full salvation find.
3500,"I am trusting, Lord, in Thee, blessed Lamb of Calvary;"
3501,"Humbly at Thy cross I bow, save me, Jesus, save me now."
3502,Long my heart has sighed for Thee; long has evil dwelt within;
3503,"Jesus sweetly speaks to me, ""I will cleanse you from all sin."""
3504,In the promises I trust; now I feel the blood applied;
3505,I am prostrate in the dust; I with Christ am crucified.
3506,"Here I give my all to Thee — Friends and time and earthly store,"
3507,Soul and body Thine to be — Wholly Thine forevermore.
3508,我今來就主十架﹐既軟弱而又貧、瞎﹔
3509,世上事盡都空虛﹐惟主恩是我所需。
3510,我今來投靠救主﹐十架下謙卑俯伏﹔
3511,求耶穌﹐神的羔羊﹐拯救我脫離滅亡。
3512,我久慕救主恩典﹐罪卻在我心掌權﹔
3513,"今聞主柔聲說道﹕""你罪孽﹐我必除掉。"""
3514,主已來充滿我心﹐並將我一切更新﹔
3515,祂寶血洗我罪愆﹐祂救贖使我完全。
3516,我在此獻上所有﹕靈、魂、體﹐親人、摯友﹐
3517,智與力﹐財物、時間—全歸主直到永遠。

3774,"See the Conqu'ror mount in triumph,"
3775,See the King in royal state
3776,Riding on the clouds His chariot
3777,To His heav'nly palace gate;
3778,Hark! The choirs of angel voices
3779,"Joyful hallelujahs sing,"
3780,And the portals high are lifted
3781,"To receive, To receive, to receive their heav'nly King."
3782,"Who is this that comes in glory,"
3783,With the trump of jubilee?
3784,"Lord of battles, God of armies,"
3785,He has gained the victory;
3786,"He who on the cross did suffer,"
3787,"He who from the grave arose,"
3788,"He has vanquished sin and Satan,"
3789,"He by death, He by death, He by death has spoiled His foes."
3790,"While He lifts His hands in blessing,"
3791,He is parted from His friends;
3792,"While their eager eyes behold Him,"
3793,He upon the clouds ascends;
3794,"He who walked with God and pleased Him,"
3795,"Preaching truth and doom to come,"
3796,"He, our Enoch, is translated"
3797,"To His home, to His home, to His everlasting home."
3798,"Now our heav'nly Aaron enters,"
3799,"With His blood, within the veil;"
3800,"Joshua now is come to Canaan,"
3801,And the kings before Him quail;
3802,Now He plants the tribes of Israel
3803,In their promised resting-place;
3804,Now our great Elijah offers
3805,"Of His grace, of His grace, double portion of His grace."
3806,He has raised our human nature
3807,On the clouds to God's right hand;
3808,"There we sit in heav'nly places,"
3809,There with Him in glory stand.
3810,"Jesus reigns, adored by angels;"
3811,Man with God is on the throne;

3820,天上城門頭全抬起-
3821,歡迎祂﹗歡迎祂﹗歡迎天上的君王。
3822,是誰帶著榮耀而來﹐
3823,吹起禧年的號聲﹖
3824,榮耀之主萬軍之神﹐
3825,祂在戰場已得勝。
3826,祂已忍受十架苦難﹐
3827,且從墳墓已復起﹔
3828,祂已除滅罪與撒但-
3829,藉著死!藉著死﹗藉死祂毀眾仇敵。
3830,正當舉手祝福之時﹐
3831,祂就離地往上升﹔
3832,正當門徒希冀眼神﹐
3833,親眼看祂去天庭。
3834,與神同行﹐使神喜悅﹐
3835,傳揚真理、審判臨﹔
3836,祂如以諾被神取去-
3837,升天庭﹗升天庭﹗得以歸回神天庭。
3838,又如亞倫進入聖所﹐
3839,帶著祂血進幔內﹔
3840,如約書亞進入迦南﹐
3841,所有仇敵都敗退。
3842,祂將我們神的選民﹐
3843,栽植應許的美地﹔
3844,如以利亞從天傾下-
3845,雙倍福﹗雙倍福﹗雙倍屬天的祝福。
3846,祂已提高我們人性﹐
3847,將我帶到神右邊﹔
3848,我們與祂同坐天上﹐
3849,與祂同住榮耀間。
3850,耶穌作王﹐天使敬拜﹐

3887,To Him all pow'r be giv'n;
3888,"No place too high for Him is found,"
3889,No place too high in heav'n.
3890,"He fills the throne — the throne above,"
3891,Its rights to Him belong;
3892,"The object of His Father's love,"
3893,Theme of the ransomed's song.
3894,Though high yet He accepts the praise
3895,His people offer here;
3896,"The faintest, feeblest cry they raise"
3897,Will reach the Saviour's ear.
3898,"This song be ours, we join in one"
3899,To celebrate the name
3900,"Of Him that sits upon the throne,"
3901,And to exalt the Lamb.
3902,"To Him whom men despise and slight,"
3903,To Him be glory giv'n:
3904,"The crown is His, and His by right"
3905,The highest place in heav'n.
3906,看哪﹗冠冕已給羔羊﹗
3907,榮耀、尊貴已歸祂﹗
3908,為祂無處算是太高﹐
3909,天上無處是太大。
3910,祂登寶座-天上寶座﹐
3911,祂登寶座何豪邁﹗
3912,祂是題目﹐聖徒所歌﹔
3913,祂是珍物﹐父所愛。
3914,祂雖高大﹐卻肯接受
3915,我們在此的殷勤﹔
3916,我們所有微弱聲音﹐
3917,無一不入救主心。
3918,我的詩歌﹐惟獨就是
3919,"高舉被殺的羔羊,"
3920,並那坐在寶座上的﹐
3921,如何應當受頌揚。
3922,祢前受人藐視厭棄﹐
3923,今得榮耀和尊貴﹔
3924,冠冕、高位﹐原是祢的﹐
3925,祢得這些真無愧﹗
3926,"Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne;"
3927,Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns all music but its own!
3928,"Awake, my soul, and sing of Him who died for thee;"
3929,And hail Him as thy matchless King thro' all eternity.
3930,"Crown Him the Lord of love! Behold His hands and side,"
3931,"Rich wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified;"
3932,"No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight,"
3933,But downward bends his wond'ring eye at mysteries so bright.
3934,Crown Him the Lord of life! who triumphed o'er the grave;
3935,Who rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save;
3936,"His glories now we sing, who died and rose on high,"
3937,"Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die."
3938,"Crown Him the Lord of heav'n! One with the Father known,"
3939,One with the Spirit through Him giv'n from yonder glorious throne!
3940,"To Thee be endless praise, for Thou for us hast died;"
3941,"Be Thou, O Lord, thro' endless days adored and magnified."
3942,冠祂—萬王之王﹐寶座上的羔羊﹔
3943,天上聖頌壓倒群響﹐獨自高昂飄揚！
3944,我魂﹐醒呀﹐歌唱﹐讚祂死味代嘗﹔
3945,讚祂是你無比君王﹐直到永世無疆。
3946,冠祂—慈愛君王！看祂雙手肋旁﹔
3947,渾身創痕仍然明見﹐卻是無比榮光。
3948,天使雖侍天上﹐不能凝視觀望﹔
3949,在祂榮耀奧秘之前﹐惟有眼目低藏。
3950,冠祂—生命君王！勝過墳墓捆綁﹔
3951,從死復活爭戰全贏﹐是為拯救淪亡。
3952,寶座﹐祂已登上！榮耀﹐聖徒來唱！
3953,祂死﹐帶下永遠生命﹔祂活﹐廢去死亡！
3954,冠祂—諸天君王！榮耀與父同享﹔
3955,升天承受聖靈無量﹐寶座活水流淌。
3956,無窮讚美獻上﹐因祢捨命身亡﹔
3957,敬拜、頌揚﹐尊祢為王﹐直到永世無疆。

3970,"How didst Thou humble Thyself to be taken,"
3971,"Led by Thy creatures, and nailed to the cross!"
3972,"Hated of men, and of God, too, forsaken,"
3973,"Shunning not darkness, the curse, and the loss!"
3974,"How hast Thou triumphed, and triumphed with glory,"
3975,"Battled death's forces, rolled back ev'ry wave!"
3976,"Can we refrain, then, from telling the story?"
3977,"Lord, Thou art Victor o'er death and the grave!"

3986,祢這神人﹐是真神﹐又是真人﹐
3987,低於天使﹐為我們作犧牲﹔
3988,女人後裔﹐曾如何親臨囂塵﹐
3989,敗壞古蛇﹐傷其頭﹐踏其身﹗
3990,創造的主﹐竟然被受造的人
3991,釘十字架﹐祢是如何降卑﹗
3992,祢不自救﹐被神棄又被人恨﹗
3993,祢不退縮﹐經黑暗﹐喝苦杯﹗
3994,接戰死亡﹐祢如何退其狂瀾﹐
3995,榮耀得勝﹐全得勝﹐大得勝﹗
3996,思念及此﹐怎能不歌頌彌漫﹗
3997,陰府的門﹐到如今全潰崩。
3998,"Jesus, Thy head, once crowned with thorns,"
3999,Is crowned with glory now;
4000,Heav'n's royal diadem adorns
4001,The mighty Victor's brow.
4002,"Thou glorious light of courts above,"
4003,"Joy of the saints below,"
4004,"To us still manifest Thy love,"
4005,That we its depths may know.
4006,"To us Thy cross with all its shame,"
4007,With all its grace be giv'n;
4008,"Though earth disowns Thy lowly name,"
4009,God honours it in heav'n.
4010,"Who suffer with Thee, Lord, today,"
4011,Shall also with Thee reign;
4012,Then let it be our joy to pay
4013,"The price, this goal attain."
4014,To us Thy cross is life and health;
4015,'Twas shame and death to Thee;
4016,"Our present glory, joy and wealth,"
4017,Our everlasting stay.

4028,地雖否認祢的微名﹐
4029,神卻使祢高升。
4030,凡肯與祢在世同苦﹐
4031,也要同榮在天﹔
4032,所以求主使我堅固﹐
4033,鄙視世界恩典。
4034,十架於祢雖是辱、死﹐
4035,在我卻是生命﹔
4036,也是我的榮耀、權勢﹐
4037,我的永遠安寧。

4532,"Wounded for me, wounded for me,"
4533,There on the cross He was wounded for me;
4534,"Gone my transgressions, and now I am free,"
4535,All because Jesus was wounded for me.
4536,"Dying for me, dying for me,"
4537,There on the cross He was dying for me;
4538,"Now in His death my redemption I see,"
4539,All because Jesus was dying for me.
4540,"Risen for me, risen for me,"
4541,Up from the grave He has risen for me;
4542,"Now evermore from death's sting I am free,"
4543,All because Jesus has risen for me.
4544,"Living for me, living for me,"
4545,Up in the skies He is living for me;
4546,"Daily He's pleading and praying for me,"
4547,All because Jesus is living for me.
4548,"Coming for me, coming for me,"
4549,One day to earth He is coming for me;
4550,"Then with what joy His dear face I shall see,"
4551,"Oh, how I praise Him! He's coming for me."
4552,為我受傷﹐為我受傷﹐
4553,加略山上﹐耶穌為我受傷﹔
4554,罪已赦免﹐我今得著釋放﹐
4555,都是因著耶穌為我受傷。
4556,為我受死﹐為我受死﹐
4557,十字架上﹐耶穌為我受死﹔
4558,救贖已成﹐魔鬼失其權勢﹐
4559,都是因著耶穌為我受死。

4567,都是因著基督為我活著。
4568,為我再來﹐為我再來﹐
4569,從天降臨﹐基督為我再來﹔

4576,"Come quickly, Lord, and tarry not!"
4577,"Oh, when wilt Thou return to comfort me?"
4578,My heart desires to be with Thee.
4579,等到何日恩主纔回來﹖
4580,我心渴望見祂丰采﹗
4581,等到何日恩主纔回來﹐
4582,好使我得奏凱﹐見心愛﹖
4583,恩主快來﹗恩主何待﹖
4584,到何日祢纔肯來慰我心懷﹖
4585,我心切慕祢同在﹗
4586,"Since Thy departure from Olivet's Mountain,"
4587,Why is Thy coming again so delayed?
4588,Thro' the long years we have longed for Thy coming;
4589,Hast Thou not heard all the prayers that we've prayed?
4590,"Come Thou, come now, Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;"
4591,"All our desire is Thy promised returning,"
4592,"Oh, may Thou quickly return."
4593,"Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended"
4594,Everything here has been tasteless and dry;
4595,"Often in praying and often in watching,"
4596,"In every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh."
4597,"Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?"
4598,Birds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;
4599,"All are delightsome, but none satisfy me,"
4600,For I am longing for Thy loving face.
4601,"Lord, we're impatient awaiting Thy coming,"
4602,We do not know how much longer 'twill be;
4603,"From every sunrise to every bright sunset,"
4604,Hope we each moment Thy coming to see.
4605,"Whene'er 'tis raining, or strong winds are blowing,"
4606,"Whene'er the moon shines, or rises the sea,"
4607,We ever hope to discover Thy coming;
4608,How disappointed when no sign of Thee!
4609,"If it were not for the bidding Thou gav'st us,"
4610,"We'd be discouraged, Thy service we'd shirk;"
4611,"But Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming,"
4612,For Thee to live and in diligence work.
4613,"Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened"
4614,Since Thou hast promised ere going away;
4615,"We hope and hope and are endlessly hoping,"
4616,That Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e'en today?
4617,自從當年橄欖山前一別離﹐
4618,至今祢仍未向我們呼召﹔
4619,歷世歷代我們都求看見祢﹐
4620,但祢好像不聽我們禱告。
4621,祢來﹗就來﹗我們呼求祢快來﹗
4622,我們的心所有盼望是祢來﹗
4623,我們等侯祢快來﹗
4624,愛主﹐自從當年祢上升之後﹐
4625,這裡都變何等枯燥無味﹔
4626,我們時在祈求﹐又時在看守﹐
4627,每一動靜﹐都疑是祢已回。
4628,景色雖美﹐祢我何日纔相聚﹖
4629,山水雖佳﹐祢今在天何方﹖
4630,花香鳥語﹐不能使我有情緒﹐
4631,因我正在思念祢的容光。
4632,主阿﹐我們等待已久﹐真焦灼﹐
4633,不知還要多少時候等待﹔
4634,從每次日出﹐直到每次日落﹐
4635,我們都是望祢能就回來。
4636,當雨每次滴瀝﹐海每次澎湃﹐
4637,風每次吹動﹐月每次照明﹐
4638,我們都望就是祢已經回來﹔
4639,何等失望﹐至今尚無動靜﹗
4640,若非記念祢臨行所賜命令﹐
4641,我們就要灰心﹐無意工作﹔
4642,但祢要我們一面等祢來迎﹐
4643,一面努力工作為祢生活。
4644,主阿﹐求祢記念日子已長久﹐
4645,應許已過多年尚未應驗﹔
4646,希望又希望﹐一直希望不休﹐
4647,要來未來﹐可否來在今天﹖
4654,"Some glorious morning sorrow will cease,"
4655,Some glorious morning all will be peace;
4656,"Heartaches all ended, schooldays all done,"
4657,"Heaven will open, Jesus will come."
4658,Some golden daybreak Jesus will come;
4659,"Some golden daybreak, battles all won,"
4660,"He'll shout the vict'ry, break thro' the blue,"
4661,"Some golden daybreak, for me, for you."
4662,"Sad hearts will gladden, all shall be bright,"
4663,Goodbye forever to earth's dark night;
4664,"Changed in a moment, like Him to be,"
4665,"Oh, glorious daybreak, Jesus I'll see."
4666,"Oh, what a meeting, there in the skies,"
4667,No tears nor crying shall dim our eyes;
4668,"Loved ones united eternally,"
4669,"Oh, what a daybreak that morn will be."
4670,哦!榮耀早晨﹐憂愁全消﹔
4671,哦！榮耀早晨﹐四境安寧﹔
4672,傷痛全止息﹐試煉終了﹔
4673,天門正大開﹐耶穌降臨！
4674,當金色黎明﹐耶穌降臨﹔
4675,當金色黎明﹐爭戰全贏﹔
4676,主得勝呼聲﹐宇宙震驚﹔
4677,當金色黎明﹐聖徒歡欣。
4678,一切放光明﹐不再憂苦﹔
4679,塵世間黑暗﹐永不再見﹔
4680,我忽然改變﹐完全像主;
4681,哦！榮耀早晨﹕耶穌顯現！
4682,哦！與主相遇﹐被提空中﹔
4683,聖徒永聯結﹐不再分離﹔
4684,眼淚全擦乾﹐死亡失蹤﹔
4685,哦！何等黎明﹐榮耀無比！
4712,I know that my Redeemer liveth
4713,And on the earth again shall stand.
4714,"I know eternal life He giveth,"
4715,That grace and pow'r are in His hand.
4716,"I know, I know that Jesus liveth"
4717,"I know, I know that life He giveth,"
4718,"I know His promise never faileth,"
4719,"The word He speaks, it cannot die;"
4720,"Tho' cruel death my flesh assaileth,"
4721,Yet I shall see Him by and by.
4722,"I know my mansion He prepareth,"
4723,That where He is there I may be.
4724,O wondrous tho't — for me He careth
4725,And He at last will come for me.
4726,我知道我救贖主活著﹐
4727,祂必再臨﹐全地尊崇﹔
4728,我知祂賜下永遠生命﹐
4729,恩典權能在祂手中。
4730,我深知道我救主活著﹐
4731,我深知道祂賜下永生﹐
4732,我知祂應許永遠堅定﹐
4733,祂的言語必不落空﹔
4734,我肉體雖受死亡逼攻﹐
4735,但我仍必面見我神。
4736,我知祂為我預備美宮﹐
4737,祂在何處我永相從﹔
4738,何等希奇祂賜我恩寵﹐
4739,再來接我相遇空中。
4740,"My King will soon come back again, the sky be filled with Him;"
4741,"The universe to be redeemed, will see His light therein."
4742,"The Lord will soon fulfill His plan, His footsteps now I hear;"
4743,His glorious frame I faintly see beginning to appear.
4744,I'm longing for His presence blest and dare not slothful be
4745,"While waiting for my Lord's return, His own dear self to see."
4746,My only hope — that He may come and change my faith to sight;
4747,There is no other joy on earth which gives my heart delight.
4748,My heart is always with Himself. My eyes are heavenward.
4749,My lips would utter nothing else but meeting with my Lord.
4750,"The coming of the Lord draws nigh, His coming is for me;"
4751,His promise ever standeth firm and soon fulfilled I'll see.
4752,"My Saviour, all Thy holy words can never doubted be;"
4753,"With them encouraged day by day, I'm faithful unto Thee."
4754,"Oh, may Thy glory soon appear, the foe be overthrown,"
4755,"Thy promises be realized, and we brought to Thy throne."
4756,"Thy saving arm a refuge is, my Saviour God, to me;"
4757,Thou as the Father keepeth them who put their trust in Thee.
4758,"The sheep and shepherd are of one, the head and body same;"
4759,None e'er can pluck from out Thy hand the child who trusts Thy name.
4760,A thousand hands won't hinder me nor will ten thousand eyes;
4761,The thorns upon the road but help me onward to the prize.
4762,"Arise, my spirit and my heart, and let the world go by;"
4763,The Lord of life will take me soon to be with Him on high.
4764,Thou healing Sun! Thou Hope of man! I really love Thy ray.
4765,"O righteous Lord! O glorious King, I bow to Thee and pray:"
4766,"Oh, may Thou soon ascend Thy throne and quickly show Thy face;"
4767,Thy heav'nly kingdom may Thou found and grant all men Thy grace.
4768,"The truth should triumph and be king, and freedom should be queen;"
4769,"But falsehood, which has rampant run, head of the world is seen."
4770,"We ask Thee, Truth, to quickly come and bring Thy light from heav'n;"
4771,The foe be crushed and all Thy sons into Thy bosom giv'n.
4772,我王必定快要再臨﹐天空都滿了祂﹔
4773,待贖宇宙快得復興﹐主要完成救法。
4774,我已聽見祂的腳聲﹐在那彩雲中間﹔
4775,我已看見祂的榮身﹐隱約顯露在天。
4776,我今仰望我主“同在﹐”不敢懈怠一點﹔
4777,我今等候我主再來﹐使我得著所天。
4778,除了我主此刻就來﹐接我與祂同在﹔
4779,除了這件美事以外﹐我心別無所愛。
4780,我眼專看我的救主﹐我心已經在天﹔
4781,我口不說別的題目﹐只說與主相見。
4782,主的再臨已經緊近﹐主來原是為我﹔
4783,主的應許永遠堅定﹐從來沒有空說。
4784,我的救主﹐祢的聖言無可惑﹐無可減﹔
4785,我今忠誠不顧臉面﹐因祢聖言自勉。
4786,願祢榮耀早日顯現﹐仇敵敗﹐陰府陷﹔
4787,願祢應許早日應驗﹐接我們到那邊。
4788,祢的膀臂是逃避所﹐耶穌救主我神﹗
4789,祢像天父一樣保妥一切靠祢的人。
4790,羊和牧者同樣輕重﹐身和頭同境遇﹔
4791,誰也不能從祢手中﹐奪去祢的兒女。
4792,千人的手不能阻我﹐萬人的眼也不﹔
4793,路上荊棘﹐不過助我忠勇進前得福。
4794,我心﹐我靈﹐今當復興﹐讓這世界過去﹗
4795,生命的主﹐求祢快臨﹐接我進入天域﹗
4796,醫治的日﹐人的盼望﹐我真愛祢光線﹗
4797,公義的主﹐榮耀的王﹐我今伏祢面前﹐
4798,求祢自己快登寶座﹗求祢臉面快顯﹗
4799,求祢伸手建立天國﹐向萬民賜恩典﹗
4800,真理本當得勝為王﹗自由本當為后﹗
4801,但是謊言竟然猖狂﹐為這世界元首﹗
4802,所以真理求祢快來﹗帶著天光而來﹗
4803,好使仇敵遇見失敗﹐眾子投入祢懷。

4909,我們裏面若無指責聲音﹐
4910,我們就必得高升。
4911,福哉人也！主來正逢儆醒﹐
4912,就必與祂同作王﹔
4913,當祂再臨﹐或夜半或天明﹐
4914,是否正逢我瞭望﹖
4915,"Since long ago at Bethany we parted,"
4916,Within my heart there is a ceaseless void;
4917,How can I take my harp down from the willow?
4918,How can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?
4919,And when at night I'm keeping lonely vigil —
4920,Grown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer —
4921,"Then I recall the promise of Thy coming,"
4922,"But sigh: O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?"
4923,Thy manger wakes the thought: I too am homeless;
4924,Thy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;
4925,"Thy coming bids me seek a better country,"
4926,For Thou Thyself art now my final goal.
4927,"Since Thou art gone, my joy has lost its flavour;"
4928,My song the sweetness I would fain convey.
4929,"Since Thou art gone, the sense of void o'erwhelms me."
4930,"Oh, how I long that Thou wilt come and not delay."
4931,"Though even now I know Thy loving presence,"
4932,Yet in my heart there's still a sense of lack.
4933,Enlightening and tenderest sustaining
4934,Can no more satisfy: I want Thee back.
4935,"Despite Thy peace within, I still feel lonely;"
4936,"Despite Thy joy, there still remains a sigh;"
4937,"When I feel most content, the silent yearning"
4938,To see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.
4939,What exile cannot but desire his homeland
4940,And long his people once again to greet?
4941,What soul on alien soil forgets his kindred?
4942,What parted lovers never yearn to meet?
4943,"O Lord, how can these earthly loves and pleasures"
4944,With all the joy of Thy return compare?
4945,"Then if I cannot here behold Thy countenance,"
4946,"What can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?"
4947,"Could'st Thou, O Lord, forget Thy word of promise"
4948,Soon to return and take me unto Thee?
4949,"Yet day by day and year by year I've waited,"
4950,And still I wait and no return I see!
4951,"Remember, Lord, the years I have been waiting"
4952,While Thy dear footsteps linger far away.
4953,"How long? How long? Oh, must I wait still longer"
4954,Till Thou shalt come again in glorious array?
4955,"From generation unto generation,"
4956,"Thy saints have come and gone, but have not seen"
4957,Thy glorious promise pass into fulfillment.
4958,"How long, how very long the time has been!"
4959,"Why cannot we, dear Lord, discern Thy footsteps?"
4960,Why are the heavens still so closely sealed?
4961,"Oh, must our waiting be prolonged still further"
4962,Before Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?
4963,"Lord, I recall the many years I've waited"
4964,"For Thy return — yet, Lord, not I alone,"
4965,But Thy dear saints through many generations —
4966,Beseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.
4967,"To countless tears and countless fervent pleadings,"
4968,By Thine appearing haste to make reply.
4969,"Oh, may Thou come, the echo of the ages,"
4970,"Come, come and answer now this mighty corp'rate cry!"
4971,自伯大尼祢與我們分手後﹐
4972,我心有個真空無可補滿﹔
4973,我坐河濱﹐將琴掛在柳枝頭﹐
4974,祢不在此﹐我怎有心鼓彈？
4975,當我深夜孤獨安靜的時侯﹐
4976,（此時我無忍受﹐我也無享受﹐）
4977,不禁歎息﹐我想著祢是多遠﹐
4978,我想著祢應許已久的歸旋。
4979,祢的馬槽使我生無家之想﹐
4980,祢的苦架使我無所欲喜﹔
4981,祢的再來使我懷未見之鄉﹐
4982,祢的自己成我追求目的。
4983,祢不在此﹐喜樂已減它滋味﹐
4984,詩歌也缺它所應有的甜美﹔
4985,祢不在此﹐終日我若有所失﹐
4986,主阿﹐我要祢來﹐我不要祢遲。
4987,雖我在此也能享受祢同在﹐
4988,但我深處依然有個缺憾﹔
4989,雖然有祢光照﹐也有祢撫愛﹐
4990,有個甚麼我不知仍不滿！
4991,平安裏面﹐我卻仍感覺孤單﹐
4992,喜樂時候﹐我仍不免有吁嘆﹔
4993,最是足意中間﹐也有不足意﹐
4994,就是我還不能當面看見祢。
4995,亡人怎不想見生長的鄉邑？
4996,俘虜怎不想見故國故人？
4997,情人分離﹐怎不一心羈兩地？
4998,兒女遠遊﹐怎不思家思親？
4999,主阿﹐我想看見祢面的心意﹐
5000,還非這些人間情形可比擬﹔
5001,現今在此﹐我無法見祢丰采﹐
5002,是否只好歎息等到祢回來！
5003,主﹐祢能否忘記祢曾經應許﹐
5004,祢要回來﹐接我與祢同在？
5005,但一天天又一年年的過去﹐
5006,我仍等候﹐祢卻仍未回來！
5007,求祢記念﹐我已等得好疲倦﹐
5008,而祢蹤跡好像當初一樣遠！
5009,多久？多久？還有多久的時候﹐
5010,祢纔應驗應許來把我提走？
5011,日出日落﹐一世過去又一代﹐
5012,祢的聖徒生活、等候、安睡﹔
5013,一位一位﹐他們已經逐漸離開﹐
5014,一次一次﹐我們望祢快回。
5015,我主﹐為何祢仍沒有顯動靜﹐
5016,天仍閉住﹐我們觀看仍對鏡﹐
5017,我們在此依然等候再等候﹐
5018,哎呀﹐是否我們等候還不夠？
5019,當我回想﹐我已等候多長久﹐
5020,不禁歎息﹐低頭獨自流淚﹔
5021,求祢別在遲延不聽我要求﹐
5022,現今就來接我與祢相會。
5023,來罷﹐我主﹐這是教會的求呼！
5024,來罷﹐我主﹐請聽聖徒的催促！
5025,來罷﹐歷世歷代累積的共鳴﹐
5026,我主﹐能否求祢今天一起聽！
5056,"Thy name we love, Lord Jesus! And lowly bow before Thee;"
5057,"And while we live, to Thee we give, all blessing, worship, glory;"
5058,"We sing aloud Thy praises, our hearts and voices blending,"
5059,"'Tis Thou alone we worthy own, Thy beauty's all transcending."
5060,"Thy name we love, Lord Jesus; it tells God's love unbounded"
5061,"To ruined man, ere time began, or heav'n and earth were founded;"

5067,"Our bitter cup Thou drankest up; the thorny crown, — didst wear it."
5068,"Thy name we love, Lord Jesus; God's Lamb — Thou wast ordained,"
5069,To bear our sins (Thyself all clean) and hast our guilt sustained;
5070,"We see Thee crowned in glory, above the heavens now seated,"
5071,"The victory won, Thy work well done, our righteousness completed."
5072,主耶穌﹐我愛祢名﹗謙卑俯伏在祢前﹔
5073,榮耀、權柄、頌讚、尊敬﹐我活時必向祢獻。
5074,向祢高歌﹐歌聲沛﹐心口同聲來歌唱﹔
5075,我魂感佩因祢是配﹐祢的美麗真非常﹗
5076,主耶穌﹐我愛祢名﹗未有天地未有時﹐
5077,神愛無境﹐就已顯明﹐要施恩典來救世。
5078,這愛真是永遠愛﹐墮落如我也眷顧﹔
5079,愛叫祢來﹐為我還債﹐使我成為祢珍物。
5080,主耶穌﹐我愛祢名﹗祢的降生何寒微﹗
5081,祢的慈心滿有恩情﹐祢的道路孤且卑。
5082,我的痛苦祢替背﹐我的荊冕祢替戴﹐
5083,我的禍杯祢替嘗備﹐常經憂患是為愛﹗
5084,"主耶穌﹐我愛祢名﹗""神的羔羊""何清潔﹗"
5085,祢被豫定為我受刑﹐流出寶血洗罪孽。
5086,現在祢坐高天上﹐尊貴、榮耀為冠冕﹐
5087,祢打勝仗﹐我得釋放﹐阿利路亞主名甜。
5088,"Take the name of Jesus with you,"
5089,Child of sorrow and of woe;
5090,"It will joy and comfort give you,"
5091,Take it then where'er you go.

5099,"How it thrills our souls with joy,"
5100,"When His loving arms receive us,"
5101,And His songs our tongues employ.
5102,"At the name of Jesus bowing,"
5103,"Falling prostrate at His feet,"
5104,"King of kings in heav'n we'll crown Him,"
5105,When our journey is complete.
5106,時常攜帶耶穌聖名﹐
5107,你們憂愁困苦人﹔
5108,祂能賜你安慰安寧﹐
5109,除去所有的煩悶。
5110,寶貝名﹐何甘甜﹗地之望並天之樂﹔
5111,寶貝名﹐何甘甜﹗地之望並天之樂。

5114,呼吸這名在心間。
5115,當祂愛手撫摸安慰﹐
5116,當我舌頭歌唱急﹐
5117,耶穌的名何等寶貝﹐
5118,使我心頭樂無極﹗
5119,旅途完畢不再勞碌﹐
5120,耶穌聖名永頌揚﹔

5146,蒙恩罪人也要歡呼﹐同聲頌讚救主﹕
5147,"""為我流血﹐將我救贖﹐使我永遠得福。"""
5148,但願能力、智慧、豐富、尊貴、榮耀、王權﹐
5149,歸給羔羊救主耶穌﹐直到永永遠遠﹗
5150,哈利路亞﹗哈利路亞﹗
5151,"Jesus! How much Thy name unfolds,"
5152,To every opened ear!
5153,The pardoned sinner's mem'ry holds
5154,None other half so dear.
5155,Thy name encircles every grace
5156,That God as man could show;
5157,There only could He fully trace
5158,A life divine below.
5159,"Jesus — it speaks a life of love,"
5160,Of sorrows meekly borne;
5161,"It tells of sympathy above,"
5162,Whatever makes us mourn.

5164,"Made sin to make us just,"
5165,"Thou gav'st Thyself our love to win,"

5184,使我蒙恩受惠﹔
5185,祢捨祢身﹐來得我心﹐
5186,今後祢重我輕。
5187,題起祢名﹐我心即伏﹐
5188,敬拜救主我主﹔

5197,耶穌乃是生命、亮光﹐乃是真理、道路﹔
5198,今在我心作主、作王﹐將我引導、安撫。
5199,寶貴救主遠勝奇珍﹐時刻滿足我心﹔

5263,"His name is wonderful, His name is wonderful,"
5264,"His name is wonderful, Jesus my Lord;"
5265,"He is the Mighty King, Master of everything;"
5266,"His name is wonderful, Jesus my Lord."
5267,"He's the great Shepherd, the Rock of all ages,"
5268,Almighty God is He.
5269,"Bow down before Him, love and adore Him."
5270,"His name is Wonderful, Jesus my Lord."
5271,祂名為奇妙﹐祂名為奇妙﹐
5272,祂名為奇妙﹐耶穌我主﹔
5273,大能的君王﹐萬有的主宰﹐
5274,祂名為奇妙﹐耶穌我主。
5275,祂是大牧人﹐祂是萬古磐石﹐
5276,祂是全能的神﹔
5277,俯伏敬拜祂﹐愛戴敬仰祂﹐
5278,"Wide, wide as the ocean, high as the heavens above;"
5279,"Deep, deep as the deepest sea, is my Saviour's love;"
5280,"I, though so unworthy, still am a child of His care,"
5281,For His word teaches me that His love reaches me ev'rywhere.
5282,廣﹐廣似洋無邊﹔高﹐高似最高的天﹔
5283,深﹐深似最深的海﹐是救主的愛。
5284,我雖然不相配﹐卻仍是救主所愛﹔
5285,因聖經告訴我﹐祂的愛處處與我同在。
5286,I am so glad that our Father in heav'n
5287,Tells of His love in the Book He has giv'n;
5288,Wonderful things in the Bible I see;
5289,"This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me."
5290,"I am so glad that Jesus loves me,"
5291,"Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;"
5292,Jesus loves even me.
5293,"Though I forget Him and wander away,"
5294,Still He doth love me wherever I stray;
5295,"Back to His dear loving arms would I flee,"
5296,When I remember that Jesus loves me.
5297,"Jesus loves me, and I know I love Him;"
5298,Love brought Him down my poor soul to redeem;
5299,"Yes, it was love made Him die on the tree;"
5300,"Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!"
5301,"If one should ask of me, how can I tell?"
5302,"Glory to Jesus, I know very well!"
5303,"God's Holy Sprit with mine doth agree,"
5304,Constantly witnessing — Jesus loves me.
5305,"In this assurance I find sweetest rest,"
5306,Trusting in Jesus I know I am blest;
5307,"Satan, dismayed, from my soul now doth flee,"
5308,When I just tell him that Jesus loves me.
5309,"Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,"
5310,"When in His beauty I see the great King,"
5311,This shall my song in eternity be;
5312,"""Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!"""
5313,我真歡樂﹐因為天上父神﹐
5314,在祂話中明說祂愛世人﹔
5315,聖經所載奇妙之事甚多﹐
5316,其最甜者﹐就是耶穌愛我。
5317,我真歡樂﹐因耶穌愛我﹗
5318,耶穌愛我﹐耶穌愛我﹔
5319,耶穌竟然愛我﹗
5320,我雖忘祂﹐一直流蕩遠離﹐
5321,祂仍愛我﹐無論流蕩何地﹔
5322,祂來尋我﹐直到將我尋著﹐
5323,並且帶回﹐因為耶穌愛我。
5324,耶穌愛我﹐我也要愛耶穌﹔
5325,愛叫祂來將我靈魂救贖﹐
5326,愛叫祂去受死擔我罪過﹔
5327,因此我就確信耶穌愛我。
5328,這愛奇妙﹐雖然我不會說﹐
5329,我卻知道﹐並且滿有把握﹗
5330,在我靈中聖靈打上印戳﹐
5331,不斷向我印證耶穌愛我。
5332,因有此證﹐我靈充滿安息﹔
5333,因有主話﹐我心不再懷疑﹔
5334,撒但驚慌﹐離我遠遠逃躲﹐
5335,當我告訴牠說﹐耶穌愛我。
5336,等進榮耀親眼看見我王﹐
5337,若有詩歌是我口舌愛唱﹐
5338,那就必是我所永要唱說﹕
5339,"""何等奇妙之事﹐耶穌愛我﹗"""
5340,"In tenderness He sought me, weary and sick with sin,"
5341,"And on His shoulders brought me back to His fold again,"
5342,While angels in His presence sang
5343,Until the courts of heaven rang.
5344,"Oh, the love that sought me! Oh, the blood that bought me!"
5345,"Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold,"
5346,Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold!
5347,"He washed the bleeding sin-wounds, and poured in oil and wine;"
5348,"He whispered to assure me, ""I've found thee, thou art Mine."""
5349,"I never heard a sweeter voice,"
5350,It made my aching heart rejoice.
5351,"He pointed to the nail-prints, for me His blood was shed;"
5352,"A mocking crown so thorny, was placed upon His head;"
5353,"I wondered what He saw in me,"
5354,To suffer such deep agony.
5355,"I'm sitting in His presence, the sunshine of His face,"
5356,"While with adoring wonder His blessings I retrace,"
5357,It seems as if eternal days
5358,Are far too short to sound His praise.
5359,"So while the hours are passing, all now is perfect rest;"
5360,"I'm waiting for the morning, the brightest and the best,"
5361,"When He will call us to His side,"
5362,"To be with Him, His spotless Bride."
5363,我曾犯罪到厭倦﹐煩悶昏沉若病﹔
5364,祂來尋覓帶回圈﹐動作滿了柔情。
5365,千萬天使充滿歡喜﹐
5366,因見恩典希奇無比﹗
5367,哦﹐這愛﹐來尋我﹗哦﹐這血﹐來贖我﹗
5368,哦﹐這恩﹐帶我歸祂羊圈﹐
5369,奇妙恩﹗帶我歸祂羊圈。
5370,我受創傷重且深﹐祂用油酒包裹﹔
5371,"祂要使我能放心﹐就說""你永屬我。"""
5372,從無聲音如此甜美﹐
5373,傷痛之心頓覺欣慰。
5374,祂指釘痕和槍傷﹐血也、水也流出﹔
5375,蘆葦、唾沫、荊棘芒﹐羞辱加上痛苦。
5376,我真不知我有何長﹐
5377,使祂竟肯為我命喪﹗
5378,我今安坐在祂前﹐瞻仰祂的榮臉﹔
5379,安靜溫習祂恩典﹐充滿希奇感歎。
5380,好像永世時日雖久﹐
5381,給我讚美仍嫌不夠。
5382,年日雖然如逝水﹐現今一切安息﹔
5383,我正等候那機會﹐能在祂前站立。
5384,那時祂召我到身邊﹐
5385,與祂同在﹐永面對面。
5386,我們雖然時常搖動﹐但祂依然歷久不變﹔
5387,祂的應許無一落空﹐天地沒有那樣貞堅。
5388,我們雖然二三其心﹐但祂不肯撇棄我們﹔
5389,雖受冷落﹐仍要親近﹐地上朋友無祂這真﹗
5390,祂永不肯辜負我們﹐所有信託祂都盡力﹔
5391,因為祂既愛了我們﹐就愛我們一直到底。
5392,到底﹗我們對祂無良﹐忘祂﹐傷祂﹐暗中心變﹔
5393,祂外﹐我們另事偶像﹐心裡也不抱歉半點﹗
5394,到這偶像傾倒絕跡﹐不禁悲傷﹐又來尋求
5395,我們從前所辜負的—這位始終如一的友﹗
5396,祂就收留安慰我們﹐並引我們親祂自己﹔
5397,一若毫無其事發生﹐並愛我們一直到底。
5398,哦﹐主﹐我們對著這愛﹐不能不發高聲讚美﹔
5399,比死堅強﹐比水忍耐﹐我們心溶﹐只有感佩﹗
5400,"O blessed Saviour, is Thy love"
5401,"So great, so full, so free?"
5402,"Fain would we have our thoughts, our hearts,"
5403,Our lives engaged with Thee.
5404,We love Thee for the glorious worth
5405,Which in Thyself we see;
5406,"We love Thee for that shameful cross,"
5407,Endured so patiently.
5408,No man of greater love can boast
5409,Than for his friend to die;
5410,Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!
5411,What love with Thine can vie?
5412,"Though in the very form of God,"
5413,"With heavenly glory crowned,"
5414,"Thou didst a servant's form assume,"
5415,Beset with sorrow round.
5416,Thou wouldst like wretched man be made
5417,"In everything but sin,"
5418,That we as like Thee might become
5419,As we unlike had been.
5420,"Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,"
5421,In every beauteous grace;
5422,"From glory unto glory changed,"
5423,Till we behold Thy face.
5424,O Lord! We treasure in our souls
5425,The memory of Thy love;
5426,And ever shall Thy name to us
5427,A grateful odour prove.
5428,我的救主﹐祢愛何以
5429,這真﹗這寬﹗這奇﹗
5430,不然﹐我心、我命、我力﹐
5431,那肯完全歸祢﹗
5432,我們愛祢﹐因祢自己
5433,上下千秋無偶﹔
5434,我們愛祢﹐因祢不避
5435,十字架的恥羞。
5436,人愛所誇﹐不過就是
5437,代友捨命的事﹔
5438,但祢卻為仇敵受死﹐
5439,誰曾愛到如此﹗
5440,雖然祢有神的形像﹐
5441,安居榮耀天庭﹔
5442,但祢卻成奴僕式樣﹐
5443,親歷憂患之境。
5444,祢願凡事與人一樣
5445,(除了罪惡無分)﹐
5446,好叫我們與祢相像﹐
5447,雖然前此不稱。
5448,像祢溫柔﹐像祢貞堅﹐
5449,像祢凡事之間﹗
5450,榮上加榮﹐天天更變﹐
5451,直到與祢相見。
5452,我們的主﹐我們的心
5453,珍藏祢的愛情﹔
5454,今後我們對祢尊名﹐
5455,永要感激、恭敬。
5460,"It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,"
5461,"My Jesus, Saviour; yet this soul of mine"
5462,"Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,"
5463,"Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,"
5464,Know more and more.
5465,"It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,"
5466,"My Jesus, Saviour; yet these lips of mine"
5467,"Would fain proclaim to sinners far and near,"
5468,"A love which can remove all guilty fear,"
5469,And love beget.
5470,"It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,"
5471,My Jesus Saviour; yet this heart of mine
5472,"Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,"
5473,"Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,"
5474,Nigh unto God.
5475,"But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know"
5476,"The fullness of Thy love, while here below,"
5477,My empty vessel I may freely bring;
5478,"O Thou who art of love the living spring,"
5479,My vessel fill.
5480,I am an empty vessel — not one thought
5481,Or look of love to Thee I've ever brought;
5482,"Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,"
5483,With this the empty sinner's only plea:
5484,Thou lovest me.
5485,"Oh, fill me, Jesus, Saviour, with Thy love!"
5486,"Lead, lead me to the living fount above;"
5487,"Thither may I in simple faith draw nigh,"
5488,"And never to another fountain fly,"
5489,But unto Thee.
5490,"Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,"
5491,"When on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,"
5492,"Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,"
5493,My soul shall sing.
5494,祢的大愛﹐過於人所能度﹐
5495,我救主耶穌﹗但不堪的我﹐
5496,真要知道它的高、深、長、闊﹐
5497,好叫它的能力越顯越多
5498,在我身上﹗
5499,祢的慈愛﹐過於人所能論﹐
5500,我救主耶穌﹗但我的嘴唇
5501,要向遠近罪人勸誨諄諄﹐
5502,告訴他們﹐祢愛能解憂困﹐
5503,並賜喜樂。
5504,祢的奇愛過於人所能讚﹐
5505,我救主耶穌﹗但我的心坎
5506,總要歌唱那愛﹐這大﹗這滿﹗
5507,因為惡性如我﹐也得恩湛﹐
5508,來親近神﹗
5509,我今雖然不能在這地方
5510,測度、講論、頌讚愛的泱漭﹔
5511,但我要帶我的虛空心房﹐
5512,來到祢這愛的泉源良港﹐
5513,求祢充滿﹗
5514,我真是一個虛空的器皿﹐
5515,對祢從無一次戀慕深情﹔
5516,但我卻能一再來祢面前﹐
5517,求祢憐恤、幫助﹐得祢恩典﹐
5518,因祢愛我﹗
5519,哦﹐我主﹐求祢用愛充滿我﹐
5520,領我到天上永活的江河﹔
5521,讓我用簡單的信到那裡﹐
5522,倚靠、鑑賞、稱羨並享受祢﹐
5523,不再他求。
5524,當我面對面看見我救主﹐
5525,當我在祂的寶座前俯伏﹐
5526,那時﹐我就要希奇並歌唱
5527,祂的大愛如何深、高、闊、長﹐
5528,並要敬拜。
5529,And can it be that I should gain
5530,An interest in the Saviour's blood?
5531,"Died He for me, who caused His pain?"
5532,"For me, who Him to death pursued?"
5533,Amazing love! How can it be
5534,"That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me."
5535,"That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me!"
5536,"He left His Father's throne above,"
5537,"So free, so infinite His grace;"
5538,"Emptied Himself of all but love,"
5539,And bled for Adam's helpless race;
5540,"'Tis mercy all, immense and free;"
5541,"For, O my God, it found out me."
5542,Long my imprisoned spirit lay
5543,Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
5544,"Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,"
5545,"I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;"
5546,"My chains fell off, my heart was free;"
5547,"I rose, went forth, and followed Thee."
5548,No condemnation now I dread;
5549,"Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!"
5550,"Alive in Him, my living Head,"
5551,"And clothed in righteousness divine,"
5552,"Bold I approach th'eternal throne,"
5553,"And claim the crown, thro' Christ my own."
5554,何能如此-如我也能
5555,得著救主寶血權利﹗
5556,為誰使祂如此痛苦﹖
5557,為我祂樂受苦至極﹗
5558,驚人大愛﹐何能如此﹗
5559,何等救主竟為我死﹗
5560,驚人大愛﹐何能如此-
5561,祂離父神榮耀寶座﹐
5562,祂的恩典無限豐富﹔
5563,除愛之外一切皆捨﹐
5564,來救無望墮落族類﹔
5565,無限憐憫闊長深厚﹐
5566,基督我神親來尋我。
5567,多年被囚困苦心靈﹐
5568,黑暗罪惡所轄奴僕﹐
5569,祢眼射出復活光線﹐
5570,其光閃耀滿我牢房﹔
5571,我鍊脫落﹐我心甦醒﹐
5572,歡然跳躍隨祢前往。
5573,永遠脫去審判恐懼﹐
5574,耶穌一切都是屬我﹔
5575,因我元首我永活著﹐
5576,穿起聖潔公義白衣﹐
5577,坦然來到父寶座前﹐
5578,因我救主來領冠冕。
5579,"Lord Jesus, when we think of Thee,"
5580,"Of all Thy love and grace,"
5581,Our spirits long and fain would see
5582,Thy beauty face to face.
5583,"And though the wilderness we tread,"
5584,"A barren, thirsty ground,"
5585,"With thorns and briars overspread,"
5586,Where foes and snares abound.
5587,"Yet in Thy love such depths we see,"
5588,Our souls o'erflow with praise
5589,Content ourselves while Lord to Thee
5590,A joyful song we raise.
5591,"Our Lord, our Life, our Rest, our Shield,"
5592,"Our Rock, our Food, our Light"
5593,Each thought of Thee doth constant yield
5594,"Unchanging, fresh delight."
5595,"Blest Saviour, keep our spirits stayed"
5596,Hard following after Thee
5597,"Till we, in robes of white arrayed,"
5598,Thy face in glory see.
5599,主耶穌﹐當我們想到
5600,祢的一切恩愛﹐
5601,我們的靈盼望最好
5602,當面見祢丰采。
5603,雖然我們行在野地﹐
5604,寂寞、乾渴、駭驚﹐
5605,左右荊棘﹐前後蒺藜﹐
5606,四圍仇敵陷阱。
5607,我們卻從深處著想﹐
5608,知道祢愛價值﹔
5609,我們因此心裡明亮﹐
5610,讚美祢恩不置。
5611,祢是我們生命、力量﹐
5612,盾牌、磐石、詩歌﹐
5613,無論怎樣把祢思想﹐
5614,總叫我們快樂。
5615,可愛的主﹐保守我們﹐
5616,緊緊跟隨祢行﹐
5617,直到我們進入天門﹐
5618,面見祢的榮形。
5619,"O Love, that wilt not let me go,"
5620,I rest my weary soul in Thee;
5621,"I give Thee back the life I owe,"
5622,That in Thine ocean depths its flow
5623,"May richer, fuller be."
5624,"O Light, that followest all my way,"
5625,I yield my flickering torch to Thee;
5626,"My heart restores its borrow'd ray,"
5627,That in Thy sunshine's blaze its day
5628,"May brighter, fairer be."
5629,"O Joy that seekest me through pain,"
5630,I cannot close my heart to Thee;
5631,"I trace the rainbow through the rain,"
5632,And feel the promise is not vain
5633,That morn shall tearless be.
5634,"O Cross that liftest up my head,"
5635,I dare not ask to fly from Thee;
5636,"I lay in dust life's glory dead,"
5637,And from the ground there blossoms red
5638,Life that shall endless be.
5639,祢這不肯放我的愛﹐
5640,疲倦的我今息於祢﹔
5641,我將餘生還祢若債﹐
5642,好使它在祢這深海
5643,能以更為豐溢。
5644,祢這照耀我路的光﹐
5645,我將殘燈帶來交祢﹔
5646,我心還祢所借火亮﹐
5647,它的日子藉祢太陽
5648,就能更為明麗。
5649,祢這用苦尋我之樂﹐
5650,我心向祢不能怨懟﹔
5651,暴雨乃是彩虹之轍﹐
5652,祢的應許祢必負責﹐
5653,轉瞬便無眼淚。
5654,祢這使我抬頭之架﹐
5655,我不敢求與祢相離﹔
5656,我的榮耀我已葬下﹐
5657,即此長出生命紅花﹐
5658,永遠開放不已。
5659,"Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,"
5660,"Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free!"
5661,"Rolling as a mighty ocean,"
5662,"In its fullness over me,"
5663,"Underneath me, all around me,"
5664,Is the current of Thy love;
5665,"Leading onward, leading homeward"
5666,To my glorious rest above.
5667,Spread His praise from shore to shore;
5668,"How He loveth, ever loveth,"
5669,"Changeth never, never more;"
5670,"How He watcheth o'er His loved ones,"
5671,Died to call them all His own;
5672,"How for them He intercedeth,"
5673,Watcheth o'er them from the throne.
5674,Love of every love the best;
5675,"'Tis an ocean vast of blessing,"
5676,'Tis a haven sweet of rest.
5677,'Tis a heav'n of heav'ns to me;
5678,"And it lifts me up to glory,"
5679,For it lifts me up to Thee.
5680,深哉﹐深哉﹐耶穌的愛﹐
5681,無限廣闊﹐無限量﹗
5682,浩浩蕩蕩有如汪洋﹐
5683,主愛臨我何週詳﹗
5684,把我蔭庇把我環繞﹐
5685,是主滔滔大慈愛﹔
5686,導我前行﹐領我歸家﹐
5687,安息天上到萬代。
5688,萬國萬民當頌讚﹗
5689,何等的愛永久的愛﹐
5690,世世代代不更變﹗
5691,祂常看顧屬祂兒女﹐
5692,在十架上祂捨身﹔
5693,為了我們父前代求﹐
5694,在寶座上常施恩。
5695,愛中至愛﹐愛無匹﹗
5696,猶如洋海祝福四溢﹐
5697,又如良港可安息。
5698,對我有如在天堂﹔
5699,領我進入榮光之中﹐
5700,領我就近祢身旁﹗
5741,"I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!"
5742,"He loved me, ere I knew Him;"
5743,"He drew me, with the cords of love,"
5744,And thus He bound me to Him.
5745,"And round my heart still closely twine,"
5746,"Those ties which naught can sever,"
5747,"For I am His and He is mine,"
5748,Forever and forever.
5749,"He bled, He died to save me;"
5750,"And not alone the gift of life,"
5751,But His own self He gave me.
5752,"Naught that I have my own I call,"
5753,I hold it for the Giver;
5754,"My heart, my strength, my life, my all"
5755,"Are His, and His forever."
5756,"So kind and true and tender,"
5757,"So wise a counselor and guide,"
5758,So mighty a defender!
5759,From Him who loves me now so well
5760,What pow'r my soul can sever?
5761,Shall life or death or earth or hell?
5762,"No, I am His forever."
5763,"All pow'r to Him is given,"
5764,"To guard me on my onward course,"
5765,And bring me safe to heaven.
5766,"Th'eternal glories gleam afar,"
5767,To nerve my faint endeavor:
5768,"So now to watch, to work, to war,"
5769,And then to rest forever.
5770,我有良友﹐其愛難述﹐
5771,愛我遠在創世前﹔
5772,慈繩愛索將我牽引﹐
5773,使我和祂永相繫。
5774,此愛堅強﹐圍繞我心﹐
5775,再無力量能分離﹔
5776,我屬我友﹐我友屬我﹐
5777,直到永世不稍渝。
5778,救贖大愛奪我心﹔
5779,流血與水﹐賜我永生﹐
5780,更以自己為賞賜。
5781,我今不再屬我自己﹐
5782,永遠歸於我救主﹔
5783,我心、我力、我命、我愛﹐
5784,全歸救主至永久。
5785,誠信真實無可比﹔
5786,祂名稱為奇妙、策士﹐
5787,是我全能護衛者。
5788,祂愛不斷向我傾瀉﹐
5789,有何力量能斷開﹔
5790,或生或死﹐今世來世﹐
5791,我屬我友到永久！
5792,一切權柄祂掌握﹔
5793,回家途中﹐有祂護衛﹐
5794,引我安然進榮耀。
5795,永世榮光﹐遠遠在望﹐
5796,使我萎靈得鼓舞﹔
5797,儆醒、爭戰、勞苦、事奉﹐
5798,與主安息享永福。
5799,"Of Jesus' love that sought me when I was lost in sin,"
5800,"Of wondrous grace that brought me back to His fold again,"
5801,Of heights and depths of mercy far deeper than the sea
5802,And higher than the heavens my theme shall ever be.
5805,"Richer, fuller, deeper, Jesus' love is sweeter,"
5806,Sweeter as the years go by.
5807,He trod in old Judea life's pathway long ago;
5808,"The people thronged about Him, His saving grace to know;"
5809,"He healed the broken-hearted, and caused the blind to see;"
5810,And still His great heart yearneth in love for even me.
5811,'Twas wondrous love which led Him for us to suffer loss-
5812,To bear without a murmur the anguish of the Cross.
5813,"With saints redeemed in glory, let us our voices raise,"
5814,Till heav'n and earth re-echo with our Redeemer's praise.
5815,主愛新鮮又甘甜﹐我要引聲頌揚﹕
5816,主既為我受苦難﹐又來住我心房﹔
5817,賜我生命與平安﹐扶持照護無間﹔
5818,主愛越久越新鮮﹐主愛越久越甜。
5821,甜過美酒甘蜜﹐我要頌揚不已﹐
5822,主的愛越久越甜。
5823,主愛長闊又高深﹐我要高聲頌揚﹕
5824,主比親者還要親﹐永不離我身旁﹐
5825,待我情深如密友﹐與我心心相印﹔
5826,主愛越久越豐厚﹐主愛越久越深。
5827,主愛溫柔又堅剛﹐我要永遠頌揚﹕
5828,主比強者還要強﹐主愛也是這樣﹔
5829,雖然天地會改遷﹐雖然海枯石爛﹐
5830,主愛至終不消減﹐主愛歷久不變。
5831,I stand amazed in the presence
5832,"Of Jesus the Nazarene,"
5833,"And wonder how He could love me,"
5834,"A sinner condemned, unclean."
5835,"How marvelous, how wonderful!"
5836,And my song shall ever be:
5837,Is my Saviour's love for me!
5838,For me it was in the garden
5839,"He prayed: ""Not My will, but Thine"";"
5840,"He had no tears for His own griefs,"
5841,But sweat-drops of blood for mine.
5842,"He took my sins and my sorrows,"
5843,He made them His very own;
5844,"He bore the burden to Calvary,"
5845,"And suffered, and died alone."
5846,When with the ransomed in glory
5847,"His face I at last shall see,"
5848,"'Twill be my joy through the ages,"
5849,To sing of His love for me.
5850,拿撒勒人耶穌面前
5851,我站立﹐心便震驚﹗
5852,希奇祂如何能愛我-
5853,定罪污穢的罪人﹗
5854,何等奇妙﹗何等驚異﹗
5855,我將永遠唱此詩﹕
5856,救主愛我愛無極﹗
5857,為我﹐祂在園中祈求﹐
5858,只願神旨得成就﹔
5859,流淚非為自己憂苦﹐
5860,汗如血點只為我﹗
5861,祂擔當我一切罪憂﹐
5862,甘願親自來背負﹔
5863,祂背我重擔至加略﹐
5864,孤單受苦並受死。
5865,當與眾聖同進榮耀﹐
5866,至終親見祂歡顏﹔
5867,這將成我無窮喜樂﹐
5868,來唱祂恩愛無極﹗
5869,"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,"
5870,That saved a wretch like me!
5871,"I once was lost, but now am found,"
5872,"Was blind, but now I see."
5873,"'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,"
5874,And grace my fears relieved;
5875,"How precious did that grace appear,"
5876,The hour I first believed!
5877,"The Lord hath promised good to me,"
5878,His word my hope secures;
5879,"He will my shield and portion be,"
5880,As long as life endures.
5881,"Through many dangers, toils, and snares,"
5882,I have already come;
5883,"'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,"
5884,And grace will lead me home.
5885,"When we've been there ten thousand years,"
5886,"Bright shining as the sun,"
5887,We've no less days to sing God's praise
5888,Than when we first begun.
5889,驚人恩典﹗何等甘甜﹐
5890,來救無賴如我﹗
5891,前曾失落﹐今被尋見﹗
5892,前盲今不摸索﹗
5893,恩典教導我心畏懼﹐
5894,又將畏懼除掉﹔
5895,恩典與我初次相遇﹐
5896,顯為何等可寶。
5897,主已應許向我施恩﹐
5898,祂話就是保證﹔
5899,祂要作我盾牌、永分﹐
5900,帶我經過此生。
5901,歷經艱險、勞碌、痛苦﹐
5902,今我已息主前﹔
5903,恩典領我跋涉長途﹐
5904,平安歸回天家。
5905,當我見主萬年之後﹐
5906,仍像太陽照耀﹐
5907,比我開始讚美時候﹐
5908,讚美仍不減少。
5924,Where shall our wond'ring souls begin?
5925,How shall we all to heav'n aspire?
5926,"As slaves redeemed from death and sin,"
5927,"As brands plucked from eternal fire,"
5928,"How shall we suited triumphs raise,"
5929,Or sing our great Deliv'rer's praise?
5930,"Oh, how shall we the goodness tell,"
5931,"Father, which Thou to us hast showed,"
5932,"Children of wrath, and doomed to hell"
5933,But children now redeemed to God?
5934,"On earth we know our sins forgiven,"
5935,Blest with this antepast of heaven.
5936,"Our hearts are full of Christ, and long"
5937,Their glorious matter to declare;
5938,"Of Him we make our loftier song,"
5939,We cannot from His praise forbear;
5940,Our ready tongues make haste to sing
5941,The glories of the heavenly King.
5942,"Fairer than all the earth-born race,"
5943,Perfect in comeliness Thou art;
5944,"Replenished are Thy lips with grace,"
5945,And full of love Thy tender heart.
5946,"God ever blest; we bow the knee,"
5947,And own all fullness dwells in Thee.
5948,我們要從那裏說起﹐
5949,主﹐祢所賜一切福氣﹖
5950,既然脫罪不作奴隸﹐
5951,既然免死不作仇敵﹐
5952,我當如何向祢拜禮﹐
5953,把祢高舉纔算適宜﹖
5954,祢向我們所施安撫﹐
5955,我們怎能用口傾吐﹖
5956,可怒之子當下火湖﹐
5957,竟然得救﹐以神為父﹗
5958,在地我知罪已抹塗﹐
5959,真是預享屬天美福。
5960,我們的心滿是基督﹐
5961,切望傾倒此中豐富﹔
5962,祢是我們詩歌題目﹐
5963,祢是我們心愛救主﹔
5964,我們舌頭急要唱出﹕
5965,天上君王榮耀萬古﹗
5966,祢比世上一切眾生﹐
5967,都更美麗﹐都更成聖﹗
5968,祢心有愛﹐祢口有恩﹔
5969,祢既受苦﹐祢又捨身﹔
5970,祢這永受頌讚的神﹗
5971,我們敬拜以靈以誠。
6024,"Jesus, Thou alone art worthy"
6025,"Ceaseless praises to receive,"
6026,"For Thy love, and grace, and goodness"
6027,Rise o'er all our thoughts conceive.
6028,"With adoring hearts, we render"
6029,"Honour to Thy precious Name,"
6030,"Overflowing with Thy mercies,"
6031,Far and wide Thy worth proclaim.
6032,"How good is the God we adore,"
6033,Our faithful unchanging Friend;
6034,"Whose love is as great as His power,"
6035,Knows neither measure nor end.
6036,"'Tis Jesus, the First and the Last"
6037,Whose Spirit shall guide us home;

6042,Praise Him! Praise Him! Till in heaven
6043,Perfected we sing His praise.

6056,耶穌﹐祢是首先、末後﹐
6057,祢要領我到盡頭﹔
6058,因著已往我讚美祢﹐
6059,為著將來我靠祢。
6060,讚祂﹗讚祂﹗讚我恩人﹗
6061,聖徒們哪﹐當高聲﹗
6062,讚祂﹗讚祂﹗直到天上﹐
6063,讚得完全讚得長。
6064,"Praise Him forevermore, praise ye the Saviour's grace."
6065,"To Him who gave His life, all glory, thanks and praise."
6066,Behold! God's Son on Calvary
6067,Was crucified for you and me.
6068,"His love is far beyond all friends' or parents' love,"
6069,Let's sing and praise His love from earth to heav'n above.
6070,Destroyed is Satan's power — how blessed is our state!
6071,Who can make us depart from God's own love so great?
6072,讚美﹐不盡讚美﹐讚美救主恩深﹔
6073,感佩﹐無限感佩﹐感佩救主捨身。
6074,看哪﹐神子在各各他﹐
6075,為你和我釘十字架。
6076,主愛遠勝爺娘﹐遠勝最好朋友﹔
6077,蒙恩罪人頌揚主愛﹐直到永久。
6078,罪人今已蒙恩﹐魔鬼今已失敗﹔
6079,誰能再使我們離開基督的愛﹖
6080,"Deep in my heart there's a gladness, Jesus has saved me from sin!"
6081,Praise to His name — what a Saviour! Cleansing without and within.
6082,Why do I sing about Jesus? Why is He precious to me?
6083,"He is my Lord and my Saviour; dying, He set me free!"
6084,"Only a glimpse of His goodness, that was sufficient for me;"
6085,"Only one look at the Saviour, then was my spirit set free."
6086,"He is the fairest of fair ones, He is the Lily, the Rose;"
6087,"Rivers of mercy surround Him, grace, love and pity He shows."
6088,在我深處充滿喜樂﹐主已救我脫罪惡﹔
6089,何等救主！讚美祂名﹐潔淨我裏外罪過。
6090,為何我要歌頌耶穌﹖為何祂這樣寶貴﹖
6091,祂是我主﹐我的救主-祂死﹐將我救回！
6092,只要一瞥祂的良善﹐我心就再無他求﹔
6093,只要一望救主榮面﹐我靈就立得自由。
6094,美者之中﹐祂是最美﹐祂是玫瑰、百合花﹔
6095,憐憫江河繞祂而流﹐恩惠慈愛祂賜下。
6106,"I sing of Thee, O blessed Christ,"
6107,Since Thou hast saved me by Thy grace;
6108,"Redeemed by Thee at dreadful price,"
6109,With angels I would sing Thy praise.
6110,"I sing of Thee, O blessed Saviour,"
6111,Thy praise shall now my tongue employ;
6112,"I'll sing of Thee, O Lord, forever,"
6113,For Thou hast filled my soul with joy.
6114,"I'll sing of Thee, and smile thro' tears,"
6115,When sorrow comes to make me sad;
6116,For I remember thro' the years
6117,"Thy grace, and sing because I'm glad."
6118,"Of Thee I'll sing while life shall last,"
6119,"At home, abroad, on land or sea;"
6120,"And when thro' death to life I've passed,"
6121,Forevermore I'll sing of Thee.
6122,我歌頌祢﹐尊貴的主﹐
6123,因祢藉恩將我救贖﹔
6124,甘付代價至昂至重﹐
6125,與眾天使向祢歌頌。
6126,我歌頌祢﹐尊貴的救主﹐
6127,盡我口舌讚美不已﹔
6128,我歌頌祢﹐永遠不止住﹐
6129,因祢使我喜樂滿溢。
6130,我歌頌祢﹐雖心如絞﹐
6131,淚痕滿面﹐猶露微笑﹔
6132,因我牢記主恩深重﹐
6133,我心歡愉﹐我口歌頌。
6134,我歌頌祢﹐一生不住﹕
6135,不分晝夜﹐不論何處﹔
6136,有日離世進入永生﹐
6137,我要永遠向祢歌頌。
6154,咒詛祂受﹐祝福我享﹔
6155,苦杯祂飲﹐愛筵我嘗﹔
6156,如此恩愛﹐蓋世無雙﹔
6157,我的心哪﹐永誌不忘。
6158,In loving kindness Jesus came
6159,"My soul in mercy to reclaim,"
6160,And from the depths of sin and shame thro' grace He lifted me.
6161,"From sinking sand He lifted me,"
6162,"With tender hand He lifted me,"
6163,"From shades of night to plains of light,"
6164,"O praise His name, He lifted me!"
6165,"He called me long before I heard,"
6166,"Before my sinful heart was stirred,"
6167,"But when I took Him at His word, forgiv'n He lifted me."
6168,"His brow was pierced with many a thorn,"
6169,"His hands by cruel nails were torn,"
6170,"When from my guilt and grief, forlorn, in love He lifted me."
6171,"Now on a higher plane I dwell,"
6172,And with my soul I know 'tis well;
6173,"Yet how or why, I cannot tell, He should have lifted me."
6174,救主耶穌由天而來﹐
6175,為要使我蒙祂慈愛﹐
6176,祂經羞辱罪惡壓害﹐伸張恩手救我。
6177,從污泥中祂拯救我﹐
6178,用慈愛手祂拯救我﹐
6179,從黑暗中進入光明﹐
6180,讚美主名﹐祂拯救我。
6181,恩主呼聲為時已久﹐
6182,惜我硬心不肯回頭﹐
6183,我今醒悟痛悔前咎﹐蒙主赦免救我。
6184,主為我戴荊棘冠冕﹐
6185,兩手被釘滴下血點﹐
6186,因我陷在罪中可憐﹐主伸愛手救我。
6187,現在我靈快樂平安﹐
6188,因我居處安全無險﹐
6189,我真難用口舌述傳﹐耶穌如何救我。

6435,In which unspotted beauteous dress
6436,"His saints have ever stood, His saints have ever stood."
6437,"How rich the character He bears,"

6919,"With His precious blood He bought us,"
6920,"In the wilderness He sought us,"
6921,To His loved ones safely brought us — O how He loves!
6922,We have found a friend in Jesus — O how He loves!
6923,'Tis His great delight to bless us — O how He loves!
6924,"How our hearts delight to hear Him,"
6925,Bid us dwell in safety near Him —
6926,Why should we distrust or fear Him? O how He loves!
6927,Through His name we are forgiven — O how He loves!
6928,Backward shall our foes be driven — O how He loves!
6929,"Best of blessings He'll provide us,"
6930,"Nought but good shall e'er betide us,"
6931,Safe to glory He will guide us; O how He loves!
6932,祂是超乎萬人之上﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6933,比諸兄弟更密更強﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6934,地上朋友時常離我﹐
6935,今日慰我﹐明日忌我﹔
6936,但這朋友從不欺我﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6937,我今享受喜樂、安康﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6938,都虧我主罪債代償﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6939,祂流寶血﹐祂買了我﹐
6940,祂來曠野﹐祂尋找我﹐
6941,同歸羊群﹐祂領導我﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6942,耶穌乃是我們朋友﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6943,祂賜福祺﹐祂賜恩祐﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6944,我心欣幸能瞻仰祂﹐
6945,叫我安居常依傍祂﹐
6946,我怎可以再頂撞祂﹖哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6947,因祂的名我得赦免﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6948,在仇敵前為我設筵﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6949,祂使最好福分臨我﹐
6950,祂禁旨外禍害侵我﹐
6951,直到榮耀祂在引我﹐哦﹐祂的愛﹗
6982,"I am amazed that God could ever love me,"
6983,"So full of sin, so covered o'er with shame;"
6984,"Make me to walk with Him who is above me,"
6985,Cleansed by the pow'r of His redeeming name.
6986,"I am amazed that God would ever save me,"
6987,Naught but the cross could take away my sin;
6988,"Thro' faith in Christ eternal life He gave me,"
6989,Now He abides forevermore within.
6990,"I am amazed that God would deign to bless me,"
6991,Choose me an heir to riches of His grace;
6992,"Till that perfection shall at last possess me,"
6993,He has reserved for all who seek His face.
6994,"I am amazed that God should grant salvation,"
6995,To such as I and all who heed His word;
6996,"Eternal life to ev'ry land and nation,"
6997,This is the wondrous message we have heard.
6998,我真希奇﹐神竟是這樣愛我—
6999,盡是羞恥﹐滿有各樣罪過﹗
7000,主名權能﹐使我得完全潔淨﹔
7001,祂又召我走屬天的路程。
7002,我真希奇﹐神竟願意來救我﹐
7003,十架功效竟能除我罪過﹗
7004,因信基督﹐祂賜我永遠生命﹐
7005,祂今居衷﹐永遠與我同行。
7006,我真希奇﹐神竟降卑賜福我—
7007,作神後嗣﹐承受恩典廣博﹗
7008,祂為尋求祂者豫備這福分﹐
7009,直到祂完全佔有我全人。
7010,我真希奇﹐神竟樂賜我救恩﹐
7011,甘願拯救一切求告的人﹗
7012,藉此無比奇妙福音的傳揚﹐
7013,永遠生命普及萬族、萬邦。
7014,"Come, Thou Fount of ev'ry blessing,"
7015,Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
7016,"Streams of mercy, never ceasing,"
7017,Call for songs of loudest praise.
7018,"Jesus sought me when a stranger,"
7019,Wand'ring from the fold of God;
7020,"He to save my soul from danger,"
7021,Interposed His precious blood.
7022,Oh to grace how great a debtor
7023,Daily I'm constrained to be!
7024,"Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,"
7025,Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
7026,"Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;"
7027,Prone to leave the God I love;
7028,"Take my heart, Oh, take and seal it"
7029,With Thy Spirit from above.
7030,"Rescued thus from sin and danger,"
7031,"Purchased by the Saviour's blood,"
7032,"May I walk on earth a stranger,"
7033,As a son and heir of God.
7034,Here I raise mine Ebenezer;
7035,Hither by Thy help I'm come;
7036,"And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,"
7037,Safely to arrive at home.
7038,來阿﹐祢這萬福泉源﹗
7039,調我心弦來稱頌﹗
7040,憐憫江河湧流不斷﹐
7041,迫我不斷來歌詠。
7042,我本外人任意流蕩﹐
7043,基督卻親來尋還﹔
7044,因著救我脫離死亡﹐
7045,竟然血濺加略山。
7046,我今天天被祢激勵﹐
7047,感覺虧欠你恩典﹔
7048,我主﹐讓此恩典維繫
7049,流蕩的心歸祢前。
7050,我承認我趨向流蕩﹐
7051,趨向離開神的愛﹔
7052,但祢竟用聖靈力量﹐
7053,將我吸引歸祢來。
7054,我今已得寶血救恩﹐
7055,脫離罪惡和死亡﹔
7056,但願我作脫俗的人﹐
7057,顯出神子的景況。
7058,我今唱起以便以謝﹐
7059,因祢幫助時有加﹔
7060,我今盼望﹐因祢喜悅﹐
7061,由祢帶領穩到家。
7062,"I hear the Saviour say, ""Thy strength indeed is small,"
7063,"Child of weakness, watch and pray, find in Me thine all in all."""
7064,"Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;"
7065,"Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow."
7066,"Lord, now indeed I find Thy pow'r and Thine alone"
7067,Can change the leper's spots and melt the heart of stone.
7068,For nothing good have I whereby Thy grace to claim —
7069,I'll wash my garments white in the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.
7070,"When from my dying bed my ransomed soul shall rise,"
7071,"Then ""Jesus paid it all!"" shall rend the vaulted skies."
7072,"And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,"
7073,"""Jesus died my soul to save,"" my lips shall still repeat."
7074,我聽救主聲音﹐說我能力薄弱﹐
7075,若非誠心相信﹐不能免去罪過。
7076,我欠千萬金﹐主替我還清﹔
7077,一生犯罪真苦辛﹐主今赦免、憐憫。
7078,主﹐我今纔看明﹐惟祢有這力量﹐
7079,能洗污穢潔淨﹐能使軟弱剛強。
7080,我真沒有善良﹐可以得主救恩﹔
7081,但主特別體諒﹐用愛救我罪人。
7082,即云我要離世﹐我仍不至戰兢﹔
7083,因我所欠罪值﹐主替我早還清。
7084,將來立在神前﹐神必不再追問﹔
7085,因主為我缺欠﹐已經流血受審。
7132,"Lord, accept our feeble song!"
7133,Pow'r and praise to Thee belong;
7134,"We would all Thy grace record,"
7135,"Holy, gracious, loving Lord!"
7136,"Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop,"
7137,Thence is all Thy people's hope;
7138,"Thou wast poor, that we might be"
7139,"Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee."
7140,Wherefore Thou high heav'n didst spurn?
7141,Wherefore Thou to earth didst turn?
7142,Why leave heav'n to come to earth
7143,"Lonely, scorned, e'en suff'ring death?"
7144,Thou in heav'n the Glorious One!
7145,"Thou on earth, the Outcast Man!"
7146,"Though this suff'ring Thou didst know,"
7147,Love would come to bear our woe.
7148,"When we think of love like this,"
7149,Joy and shame our hearts possess;
7150,"Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus;"
7151,"Shame, for such returns from us."
7152,Yet we hope the day to see
7153,"When from ev'ry hindrance free,"
7154,"When to Thee, in glory, brought,"
7155,We shall serve Thee as we ought.
7156,"Now, O Lord, we wait for Thee,"
7157,"Wait ""the blessed hope"" to see."
7158,"May we ever for Thee live,"
7159,Till Thy church Thou dost receive.
7160,主﹐接納我們的詩歌﹐
7161,雖然聲音頂柔弱﹔
7162,我們述說祢的恩篤﹐
7163,因祢是我們救主。
7164,因祢捨去榮耀、豐富﹐
7165,祢的信徒纔得福﹔
7166,祢變貧窮﹐叫祢信徒
7167,因祢享榮耀、豐富。
7168,天堂有何使祢心厭﹖
7169,世界有何使祢羨﹖
7170,因而祢就離天臨世﹐
7171,孤單、淒涼直到死﹖
7172,祢在天上何等榮耀﹗
7173,祢在世上何蕭條﹗
7174,祢早已知此行艱難﹐
7175,只因愛我不計算。
7176,當我想到祢的良善﹐
7177,就不禁又喜又慚﹗
7178,喜﹐因祢能這樣愛好﹔
7179,慚﹐因我這樣還報。
7180,但我們望那日快到﹐
7181,脫盡所有的阻撓﹔
7182,那時我們進榮耀裏﹐
7183,要照本分服事祢。
7184,現今我們等在這裏﹐
7185,因這盼望受策勵﹔
7186,主﹐使我們活著為祢﹐
7187,直到天上同聚集。
7188,"There's within my heart a melody,"
7189,Jesus whispers sweet and low:
7190,"""Fear not, I am with thee; peace be still,"
7191,In all of life's ebb and flow.”
7192,"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, sweetest name I know,"
7193,"Fills my every longing, keeps me singing as I go."
7194,"All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,"
7195,"Discord filled my heart with pain,"
7196,"Jesus swept across the broken strings,"
7197,Stirred the slumb'ring chords again.
7198,"Feasting on the riches of His grace,"
7199,"Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing,"
7200,"Always looking on His smiling face,"
7201,That is why I shout and sing.
7202,Though sometimes He leads through waters deep
7203,"Trials fall across the way,"
7204,"Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep,"
7205,See His footprints all the way.
7206,Soon He's coming back to welcome me
7207,Far beyond the starry sky;
7208,"I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown,"
7209,I shall reign with Him on high.
7210,彷彿音樂湧在我心懷﹐
7211,耶穌正在柔聲說﹕
7212,“平安﹐平安﹐我與你同在﹐
7213,不管人生的漲落。”
7214,耶穌﹗耶穌﹗耶穌﹗地上最甜名﹔
7215,滿足我的要求﹐使我能邊唱邊行。
7216,我的一生都被罪苦害﹐
7217,我心掙扎無和諧﹔
7218,直到耶穌充滿我心懷﹐
7219,心弦又復發音樂。
7220,我今享受祂賜的恩典﹐
7221,安息在祂的翅膀﹔
7222,時常仰視祂顯的笑臉﹐
7223,故我歡呼又歌唱。
7224,有時祂領我經歷深水﹐
7225,路上橫來試煉重﹔
7226,有時道路好像是傾危﹐
7227,處處我見祂腳蹤。
7228,不久祂來要將我迎接﹐
7229,到那遙遠的星鄉﹔
7230,我要飛入莫名的世界﹐
7231,並要與祂同作王。
7232,His grace aboundeth more. His grace aboundeth more;
7233,"Tho' sin abounded in my heart, His grace aboundeth more."
7234,主恩實在更多！主恩實在更多！
7235,我罪雖多﹐主血塗抹﹐主恩實在更多！
7294,"I have a song that Jesus gave me,"
7295,It was sent from heav'n above;
7296,"There never was a sweeter melody,"
7297,'Tis a melody of love.
7298,"In my heart there rings a melody,"
7299,There rings a melody with heaven's harmony;
7300,In my heart there rings a melody;
7301,There rings a melody of love.
7302,"I love the Christ who died on Calv'ry,"
7303,For He washed my sins away;
7304,"He put within my heart a melody,"
7305,And I know it's there to stay.
7306,"'Twill be my endless theme in glory,"
7307,With the angels I will sing;
7308,"'Twill be a song with glorious harmony,"
7309,When the courts of heaven ring.
7310,耶穌是我心最甜詩歌﹐
7311,天來音樂何美妙﹔
7312,從無一歌曲如此的超絕﹐
7313,這是奇妙愛之歌。
7314,在我心中唱一甜美詩歌﹐
7315,唱一甜美詩歌﹐唱天上樂歌﹔
7316,唱那奇妙愛之歌。
7317,奇妙愛﹐救主贏得我心﹐
7318,祂血洗我何清潔﹔
7319,祂在我心奏一甜美詩歌﹐
7320,我正甜美的唱著。
7321,無終歌﹐當我進入榮耀﹐
7322,與眾天使同頌讚﹔
7323,"寶座前聖徒齊聲唱新詩,"
7324,此歌聲音何佳妙。
7404,"My Jesus is the living Bread,"
7405,My Jesus is the Fountainhead;
7406,"And who so drinketh, Jesus said,"
7407,"Shall never, never thirst again."
7408,What! Never thirst again?
7409,"No, never thirst again!"
7410,"Shall never, never thirst again!"
7411,我主耶穌是生命源﹐
7412,我主耶穌是活水泉﹔
7413,主曾明說﹕“喝了這水﹐
7414,就永遠永遠不再渴。”
7415,難道永遠不再渴﹖
7416,是！永遠不再渴！
7423,"Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer;"
7424,"Sing, O earth! His wonderful love proclaim!"
7425,Hail Him! hail Him! highest archangels in glory;
7426,Strength and honour give to His holy Name.
7427,"Like a shepherd Jesus will guard His children,"
7428,In His arms He carries them all day long:
7429,Praise Him! praise Him! Tell of His excellent greatness!
7430,Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song!
7431,"Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,"
7432,For our sins He suffered and bled and died.
7433,"He, our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,"
7434,"Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus, the Crucified;"
7435,"Sound His praises, Jesus who bore our sorrows"
7436,"Love unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong:"
7437,"Heav'nly portals, loud with hosannahs ring!"
7438,"Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever;"
7439,Crown Him! crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King!
7440,"Christ is coming, over the world victorious,"
7441,Pow'r and glory unto the Lord belong:
7442,讚祂﹗讚祂﹗讚美耶穌﹐我救贖主﹗
7443,全地都唱﹐將祂奇愛宣明。
7444,頌祂﹗頌祂﹗榮耀天使都要俯伏﹗
7445,能力、尊貴﹐歸於祂的聖名﹗
7446,有如牧者﹐主將自己人保護﹐
7447,祂的膀臂懷抱他們安寧。
7448,讚祂﹗讚祂﹗將祂非常偉大顯出﹐
7449,讚祂﹗讚祂﹗帶著快樂心情。
7450,祂為我罪受苦、流血、受刑﹔
7451,祂是磐石﹐我們救恩永遠穩固。
7452,頌祂﹗頌祂﹗耶穌為我被釘﹗
7453,高聲讚祂﹗主擔當我的痛苦﹗
7454,此愛無邊、奇妙、貞堅、絕頂。
7455,響徹天門﹐“和散那”聲飛揚﹗
7456,基督耶穌﹐從天降臨﹐復興萬物﹐
7457,冠祂﹗冠祂﹗祭司﹐先知﹐君王﹗
7458,基督耶穌﹐得勝一切﹐立國度﹐
7459,榮耀權柄﹐永歸我主﹐我王﹗
7490,"More love to Thee, O Christ, more love to Thee!"
7491,Hear Thou the pray'r I make on bended knee;
7492,"This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ to Thee,"
7493,"More love to Thee, more love to Thee!"
7494,"Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;"
7495,"Now Thee alone I seek, give what is best;"
7496,"This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to Thee,"
7497,"Let sorrow do its work, send grief and pain;"
7498,"Sweet are Thy messengers, sweet their refrain,"
7499,"When they can sing with me: ""More love, O Christ, to Thee,"
7500,"More love to Thee, more love to Thee!"""
7501,Then shall my latest breath whisper Thy praise;
7502,This be the parting cry my heart shall raise;
7503,"This still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to Thee,"
7504,我願愛祢更深﹗愛祢更深﹗
7505,哦﹐主﹐聽此求懇﹐成此心意。
7506,我心真是切慕﹔愛祢更深﹐我主﹐
7507,愛祢更深﹐愛祢更深﹗
7508,前我追求祝福、平安、喜樂﹔
7509,今只尋求基督﹐解我乾渴。
7510,我今惟獨切慕﹕愛祢更深﹐我主﹐
7511,祢可差遣傷悲﹐將我試煉﹔
7512,祢的使者何美﹐其歌何甜﹗
7513,我同他們唱出﹕愛祢更深﹐我主﹐
7514,直到呼吸漸促﹐歌聲漸收﹐
7515,我心仍要發出臨別節奏﹐
7516,我心仍是渴慕﹕愛祢更深﹐我主﹐
7517,"My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine!"
7518,For Thee all the follies of sin I resign;
7519,"My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou!"
7520,"If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now!"
7521,"I love Thee, because Thou hast first loved me,"
7522,And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
7523,I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
7524,"I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,"
7525,And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
7526,And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow:
7527,"""If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now!"""
7528,"In mansions of glory and endless delight,"
7529,I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;
7530,I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow:
7531,我耶穌﹐我愛祢﹐知道祢屬我﹔
7532,所有愚昧快樂﹐我為祢擺脫。
7533,祢是我的救主﹐流血將我買﹔
7534,我若曾愛祢﹐主﹐應當是現在﹗
7535,我耶穌﹐我愛祢﹐因祢先愛我﹔
7536,為我釘十字架﹐救贖已穩妥。
7537,我愛祢﹐因為祢肯為我受害﹔
7538,活著﹐我是愛祢﹐死﹐我也愛祢﹔
7539,我口要讚美祢﹐只要存一息。
7540,無論或生或死﹐此心不稍改﹕
7541,在那快樂無窮榮耀無比地﹐
7542,我要在祢面前永遠稱頌祢﹔
7543,我頭戴上冠冕﹐還要唱出來﹕
7544,"Day and night do I think of Thy love, O Lord,"
7545,Its height and its depth — O how great!
7546,"Pouring down like a great waterfall, O Lord,"
7547,Thy love doth my being elate.
7548,"Thou didst come down from heav'n for love's sake, O Lord,"
7549,Forsaking Thy glory and Thy throne.
7550,"Thou wast born Son of Man under law, O Lord,"
7551,Without any wealth called Thine own.
7552,"All my love is poured out at Thy feet, O Lord,"
7553,"None can satisfy my heart so well,"
7554,"Most delightful and precious art Thou, O Lord."
7555,I love in Thy bosom to dwell.
7556,"Like a savory feast is Thy love, O Lord,"
7557,My whole being to satisfy.
7558,"How I thank Thee for taking my place, O Lord,"
7559,To endure the cross and to die.
7560,"Thou hast rescued me from sin and death, O Lord,"
7561,Thy blood washed my heart white as snow.
7562,"Thou hast sent Thy Spirit to help me, O Lord,"
7563,That I might please Thee here below.
7564,"Day and night do I long for Thy home, O Lord,"
7565,That Thou art preparing for me.
7566,"O what joy to walk on streets of gold, O Lord,"
7567,No more pain and tears will I see.
7568,"To abide in Thy grace and Thy love, O Lord,"
7569,What blessing divine beyond compare!
7570,"For Thy love is the same to the end, O Lord,"
7571,Thy glory is seen everywhere.
7572,我晝夜常思念祢的愛﹐耶穌﹗
7573,不能測長闊與高深﹔
7574,如瀑布從高處澆下來﹐耶穌﹗
7575,使我心快樂頌主恩。
7576,祢因愛成肉身來此世﹐耶穌﹗
7577,捨棄祢榮光大寶座﹔
7578,竟生在律法下為人子﹐耶穌﹗
7579,甘心受貧寒無枕所。
7580,我的愛都澆奠祢腳前﹐耶穌﹗
7581,因祢比萬有滿我意﹔
7582,祢到底又盡美又盡善﹐耶穌﹗
7583,我心歡喜住祢懷裏。
7584,祢的愛如筵席氣味香﹐耶穌﹗
7585,讓我蒙恩人來飽嘗﹔
7586,多虧祢在十架代死亡﹐耶穌﹗
7587,甘願被咒詛掛架上。
7588,救贖我出死亡脫罪惡﹐耶穌﹗
7589,祢血洗淨我白如雪﹔
7590,又差遣保惠師訓誨我﹐耶穌﹗
7591,行事得蒙主常喜悅。
7592,我晝夜常羨慕祢的家﹐耶穌﹗
7593,在天為聖徒備安宅﹕
7594,黃金街碧玉城樂無涯﹐耶穌﹗
7595,不再有痛苦與悲哀。
7596,得常在祢恩惠慈愛中﹐耶穌﹗
7597,諸天所有福難較量﹔
7598,祢的愛至永遠不變更﹐耶穌﹗
7599,榮耀圍繞我成光浪。
7600,"O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord!"
7601,"Forgive me if I say,"
7602,"For very love, Thy sacred Name"
7603,A thousand times a day.
7604,"O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;"
7605,"I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;"
7606,Thy gracious smile is my reward;
7607,"I love, I love Thee, Lord!"
7608,I love Thee so I know not how
7609,My transports to control;
7610,Thy love is like a burning fire
7611,Within my very soul.
7612,For Thou to me art all in all:
7613,"My honour and my wealth,"
7614,"My heart's desire, my body's strength,"
7615,My soul's eternal health.
7616,"Burn, burn, O love, within my heart!"
7617,"Burn fiercely night and day,"
7618,Till all the dross of earthly loves
7619,"Is burned, and burned away."
7620,"O light in darkness, joy in grief,"
7621,O heav'n begun on earth;
7622,"Jesus my love, my treasure, who"
7623,Can tell what Thou art worth?
7624,What limit is there to this love?
7625,Thy flight where will Thou stay?
7626,"On, on! Our Lord is sweeter far"
7627,Today than yesterday.
7628,耶穌﹐耶穌﹐我的性命﹐
7629,因為愛的緣故﹐
7630,求原諒我﹐將祢聖名﹐
7631,日念千遍不住。
7632,耶穌﹐耶穌﹐最愛救主﹐
7633,無人無物與祢比擬﹔
7634,祢的笑容是我歡喜﹐
7635,我愛﹐愛祢﹐祢﹐主。
7636,我心愛祢﹐不知如何
7637,約束我的奇樂﹔
7638,祢愛有如一團熱火﹐
7639,使我心中火熱。
7640,因祢是我一切、一切﹕
7641,我的倚靠、食糧﹐
7642,我心羨慕﹐我身醫藥﹐
7643,我魂永遠力量。
7644,燒﹐燒﹐哦愛﹐在我心懷﹐
7645,日夜厲害的燒﹐
7646,直至所有其他的愛
7647,燒到無處可找。
7648,暗中之光﹐憂中之樂﹐
7649,天在地上開始﹔
7650,耶穌﹐祢是我愛、我歌﹐
7651,有誰知祢價值﹗
7652,這愛將受甚麼限制﹖
7653,要到那裏停止﹖
7654,進﹐進﹐我主﹐甘甜價值
7655,今日遠勝昨日。
7661,"Down from His splendor in glory He came,"
7662,Into a world of woe;
7663,"Took on Himself all my guilt and my shame,"
7664,Why should He love me so?
7665,"How can I help but love Him,"
7666,When He loved me so?
7667,"I am unworthy to take of His grace,"
7668,Wonderful grace so free;
7669,"Yet Jesus suffered and died in my place,"
7670,E'en for a soul like me.
7671,"He is the fairest of thousands to me,"
7672,His love is sweet and true;
7673,"Wonderful beauty in Him I now see,"
7674,More than I ever knew.
7675,從祂莊嚴榮耀高處降卑﹐
7676,來此災禍之世﹔
7677,祂竟親自背負我的罪恥﹗
7678,何竟如此愛我﹖
7679,怎能叫我不愛主﹖
7680,祂這樣愛我﹗
7681,我真不配得祂奇妙恩典﹐
7682,恩典何等豐富﹗
7683,受苦﹐受死﹐站在罪人地位﹐
7684,竟為不值如我﹗
7685,千萬人中﹐救主最為甜美﹐
7686,祂愛至甜至真﹔
7687,我今看見主的超凡美麗﹐
7688,遠超以往所知。
7689,主阿！我深愛祢﹐甚願我永屬祢﹔
7690,願祢居我靈裏﹐永不分離。
7691,主阿！我深愛祢﹐我是永遠屬祢﹔
7692,因祢已先愛我﹐為我捨己。
7693,在天﹐我還有誰﹖在地﹐亦無所愛！
7694,惟願掬我衷情﹐傾於主宰。
7695,金銀雖有千萬﹐聲譽可遍塵寰﹔
7696,一旦若失了祢﹐我心何安﹖
7697,除祢﹐別無所求﹐惟祢﹐能解我憂﹔
7698,世人都難久靠﹐祢愛無休。
7713,"Jesus, Thine all victorious love"
7714,Shed in my soul abroad;
7715,"Then shall my heart no longer rove,"
7716,"Rooted and fix'd in God,"
7717,Rooted and fix'd in God.
7718,"Oh, that in me the sacred fire"
7719,Might now begin to glow!
7720,"Burn up the dross of base desire,"
7721,"And make the mountains flow,"
7722,And make the mountains flow.
7723,"Thou, who at Pentecost didst fall,"
7724,Do Thou my sins consume;
7725,"Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call;"
7726,"Spirit of burning, come!"
7727,"Refining Fire, go through my heart,"
7728,Illuminate my soul;
7729,"Scatter Thy life through every part,"
7730,"And sanctify the whole,"
7731,And sanctify the whole.
7732,"My steadfast soul, from falling free,"
7733,"Shall then no longer move,"
7734,While Christ is all the world to me
7735,"And all my heart is love,"
7736,And all my heart is love.
7737,耶穌﹐祢的全勝的愛﹐
7738,已經澆灌我心﹔
7739,我心就不再會搖擺﹐
7740,就能生根於神﹐
7741,就能生根於神。
7742,但願聖火今在我心﹐
7743,就已發旺不休﹐
7744,燒掉所有卑情下品﹐
7745,並使高山鎔流﹐
7746,並使高山鎔流。
7747,祢曾賜下祭壇火炭﹐
7748,求祢燒掉我罪﹔
7749,我向焚燒的靈呼喊﹐
7750,聖靈滿我心內﹐
7751,聖靈滿我心內。
7752,我心要接鍛鍊的火﹐
7753,照亮我魂光耀﹔
7754,散佈生命在每角落﹐
7755,並使全人聖潔﹐
7756,並使全人聖潔。
7757,搖動的心求祢扶掖﹐
7758,使它變成堅崖﹔
7759,基督成為我的世界﹐
7760,我的全心成愛﹐
7761,我的全心成愛。
7762,"O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me,"
7763,Teach me how to breathe Thee in;
7764,"Help me pour into Thy bosom,"
7765,All my life of self and sin.
7766,"I am breathing out my sorrow,"
7767,Breathing out my sin;
7768,"I am breathing, breathing, breathing,"
7769,All Thy fullness in.
7770,"I am breathing out my own life,"
7771,That I may be filled with Thine;
7772,"Letting go my strength and weakness,"
7773,Breathing in Thy life divine.
7774,"Breathing out my sinful nature,"
7775,Thou hast borne it all for me;
7776,"Breathing in Thy cleansing fullness,"
7777,Finding all my life in Thee.
7778,On Thy kind and gentle breast;
7779,"Breathing in Thy joy and comfort,"
7780,Breathing in Thy peace and rest.
7781,"I am breathing out my sickness,"
7782,Thou hast borne its burden too;
7783,"I am breathing in Thy healing,"
7784,"Ever promised, ever new."
7785,I am breathing out my longings
7786,"In Thy list'ning, loving ear;"
7787,"I am breathing in Thy answers,"
7788,Stilling every doubt and fear.
7789,"I am breathing every moment,"
7790,Drawing all my life from Thee;
7791,"Breath by breath I live upon Thee,"
7792,"Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me."
7793,主﹐求祢向我吹聖靈﹐
7794,教我如何吸入祢﹔
7795,助我向祢胸懷一傾
7796,我的犯罪與自己。
7797,我是呼出我的愁苦﹐
7798,呼出我罪污﹔
7799,我是吸入﹐一直吸入﹐
7800,祢所有豐富。
7801,我是呼出我的生命﹐

7825,"Oft before the Lord, I was praying earnestly,"
7826,Hoping I from sin might be set free;
7827,Then one day in mercy the Lord revealed in me
7828,How the Spirit dwells in me.
7829,"Yes, the Spirit dwells in me,"
7830,Giving me such liberty.
7831,"He hast set me free from sin,"
7832,Brought new songs of praise within;
7833,"Yes, the Spirit dwells in me."
7834,"Such a crippled child, full of weakness for so long,"
7835,I knew well that I should be made strong.
7836,"Joy swept o'er my soul, when the Spirit came along"
7837,And revealed that He's in me.
7838,"I can testify of the Spirit's pow'r inside,"
7839,For my heart is fully opened wide.
7840,"I have turned away from all works of sin and pride,"
7841,For the Spirit dwells in me.
7842,"Now I know for sure I can see my Saviour's face,"
7843,For the Lord did all my sin erase;
7844,And a crown for me is prepared in that blest place.
7845,"Yes, He ever lives in me!"
7846,我在主前等候﹐並且專心祈禱﹐
7847,盼望能以從罪得釋放﹔

7851,聖靈解開我捆綁﹔
7852,我就從罪得釋放﹐
7853,我就心口滿頌揚﹐
7854,我是多年軟弱、殘廢、無用孩子﹐
7855,而又明知自己當行動﹔
7856,主是忽然施恩﹐使我滿口是詩﹐
7857,我今能以見證聖靈奇妙能力﹐
7858,因為我心已經被倒空﹐
7859,我已脫離驕傲﹐我已洗淨罪習﹐
7860,我今已有把握﹐我能看見神面﹐
7861,因主已經將我洗透通﹔
7862,主已登記我名配給榮耀冠冕﹐
7863,"Walking in the comfort of the Holy Ghost,"
7864,Walking with the Lord day by day;
7865,"Going step by step, in the light of His word,"
7866,Company and strength all the way.
7867,"Walking, yes, I'm walking in the Spirit of my Lord!"

7869,"So He keeps me still, strong to do His will,"
7870,Walking in His comfort day by day.
7871,Oh! what peace my heart now doth know;
7872,"Living in His light, singing in His joy!"
7873,Music in my soul all aglow.
7874,How sweet is my life in the Lord!
7875,"List'ning to His voice, doing His good will,"
7876,Conquering thro' faith in His word.
7877,"Free from all sin, all care and pain;"
7878,"Praying, working, trusting sweetly all the way,"
7879,Waiting 'til my Lord comes again.

7937,Send us by Thy Spirit power from on high.
7938,"Power, power, power from on high."
7939,"Promise of the Father, Spirit, ever nigh,"
7940,"Wherefore should we languish, wherefore should we die?"
7941,Thou hast come to bring us power from on high.

7976,Clothe us with pow'r we pray!
7977,"We are waiting, and to Thee we bow,"

8117,The filling of Thy Spirit To live for Thee I seek.
8118,"Oh, from myself deliver, From all its misery;"
8119,I'd henceforth be forever Completely filled with Thee.
8120,"Oh, Lord, how dry my heart is, It yearns and pants for Thee;"
8121,The filling of Thy Spirit Is now my fervent plea.
8122,"Within the smitten Rock, Lord, I would entirely hide;"
8123,"Pour thro' Thy living water, Till I am satisfied."
8124,"How cold my heart has been, Lord, How slow obeying Thee;"
8125,"So fill me with Thy Spirit, I'll ne'er rebellious be."
8126,I lie upon Thy altar And dare not move away;
8127,"Oh, may Thy flame descending, Consume my all, I pray."
8128,"Oh, may Thy Cross within me Deepen its work and burn,"
8129,"In me enlarge Thy measure, And me to ashes turn."
8130,"Oh, may Thy Spirit fill me Each day more than before,"
8131,And may Thy living water On me and thro' me pour.
8132,求主寶血潔淨我，洗盡所有罪過；
8133,將祢聖潔的膏油，重新為我塗抹。
8134,我認自己的生活，真是失敗、軟弱；
8135,我望充滿祢的靈，完全為祢而活。
8136,哦，求主救我脫離這個可憐的自己！
8137,好使我從今天起，完全充滿了祢。
8138,我心何等的乾旱，常為軟弱悲歎；
8139,我是何等的盼望能被聖靈充滿。
8140,求主讓我今隱藏在祢擊傷石磐；
8141,求主今聽我呼求，讓祢活水氾濫。
8142,我心何等的冷淡，順服何等遲慢；
8143,願主聖靈充滿我，使我不再背叛。
8144,我今躺臥在祭壇，不敢稍微動彈；
8145,求主烈火從天降，把我所有燒乾。
8146,求主十架在我身，天天作工更深；
8147,把我度量擴充大，使我化為灰塵。
8148,好叫聖靈充滿我，天天比前更多；
8149,祢的活水到處流，解除眾人乾渴。
8166,"Oh, have we grieved Thee, gracious Spirit?"

8169,Never yet have wearied Thee.
8170,"Holy Ghost come down upon Thy children,"
8171,"Give us grace, and make us Thine;"
8172,"Thy cleansing fires within us kindle,"
8173,"Blessed Spirit, Dove Divine!"
8174,Dear Paraclete! how hast Thou waited
8175,While our hearts were slowly turned!
8176,"How often hath Thy love been slighted,"
8177,While for us it grieved and burned!
8178,"Now in our hearts, O blessed Spirit,"
8179,We would take Thee for our Lord;
8180,"In perfect love now make us faithful,"
8181,To Thy least and lightest word.
8182,O Comforter! tho' now we cannot
8183,Love Thee as Thou lovest us;
8184,"If in our hearts Thy flame be kindled,"
8185,They shall not be always thus.
8186,主﹐我曾否叫聖靈憂愁﹐
8187,流蕩、隨便並冷落﹖
8188,然而我的犯罪和退後﹐
8189,未曾叫祂厭倦過。
8190,求祢多賜我們以聖靈﹐
8191,讓祂光照並焚燒﹐
8192,將“祢”供給我們作生命﹐
8193,使我不住的禱告。
8194,祢的聖靈曾如何忍耐﹐
8195,等我慢慢心轉變﹔
8196,我曾如何棄絕祢熱愛﹐
8197,當祂為我憂心煎。
8198,祢的聖靈今在我心內﹐
8199,我要以祂為我主﹔
8200,因為愛祢使我能敬畏﹐
8201,祢的最小的宣佈。
8202,我們現今雖不能愛祢
8203,如祢那樣愛我們﹔
8204,祢在我心若將火點起﹐
8205,它就不會終冷沉。
8206,"Spirit of the living God, fall fresh on me;"
8207,"Spirit of the living God, fall fresh on me."
8208,"Break me, melt me, mold me, fill me."
8209,我神﹐求祢用聖靈再充滿我﹗
8210,破我、鎔我、模我、造我﹐
8211,"First the blood, then anointing oil; cleansing, then can blessing flow."
8212,"Without passing through Calvary, Pentecost we'll never know."
8213,"Without purging of the soul, pow'r from on high cannot flow."
8214,"If true witnesses we would be, self-life to the cross must go."
8215,"Work in me, Lord — work thro' the cross, that my soul-life deceased be."
8216,"Whate'er the price, I would receive Thy Spirit's fullness in me."
8217,"Christ, the Rock, must be smitten first; then the living waters flow."
8218,"If death has not performed its work, then the Spirit ne'er can flow."
8219,"If we truly died with Christ, counting all things to be loss,"
8220,Then God's power will surely come down upon us in due course.
8221,"First the altar, and then the fire; without loss, there is no gain."
8222,"If we fail to surrender all, we will never with Him reign."
8223,"If our all we yield to God a true sacrifice to make,"
8224,God will surely entrust these ones of His power to partake.
8225,"First, the vessel must emptied be, then the oil can it contain."
8226,"First, the ditches must be dug out, then much water will remain."
8227,"First, the Jordan must be passed, double portion then bestowed."
8228,"First the baptism, then the dove; first the death, then life be showed."
8229,When we look at the harvest field — how the golden grains abound —
8230,We should know how a grain of wheat had its death below the ground.
8231,"To obtain the grains of life, there must be death's awesome hour."
8232,"Without going through Calvary, there can be no Spirit's pow'r."
8233,"Since the truth is revealed, my Lord, help me go the narrow way."
8234,"Strip me of all my self and pride; suff'ring all, I would obey."
8235,I pray not for greater pow'r — deeper death is all I need.
8236,"Let the full meaning of the cross be fulfilled in me, I plead."
8237,後是膏油先是血﹐要得滋潤先得潔﹔
8238,若非經過各各他﹐必不能到五旬節。
8239,我們若未蒙洗淨﹐能力必不從上傾﹔
8240,我們若要作見證﹐必須釘死己生命。
8241,因此﹐求主藉十字架﹐治死我的魂生命﹔
8242,使我願出重大代價﹐來滿受祢的聖靈。
8243,先是用杖擊石磐﹐後來活水纔溢漫﹔
8244,死亡若未作過工﹐聖靈必定不充滿。
8245,我們若真同主死﹐願意萬有都損失﹔
8246,主的能力要降臨﹐使用我們來救世。
8247,先是祭壇後是火﹐若沒喪失就沒果﹔
8248,若非所有先奉獻﹐必定不能登寶座。
8249,我們若真肯犧牲﹐捨棄萬事降服神﹔
8250,我們必定得能力﹐因主信託順從人。
8251,先是預備瓶子空﹐後是膏油盛其中﹔
8252,先是山谷挖成溝﹐後來活水才深泓﹔
8253,先是經過約但河﹐後是靈感加倍得﹔
8254,先受死亡的浸洗﹐後得榮耀的聖鴿。
8255,當你舉目望禾田﹐金穀豐盈你稱羨﹔
8256,當念果實未生時﹐就有麥種死在先。
8257,若要生命的子粒﹐須有死亡的經歷﹔
8258,凡未到過髑髏地﹐就無聖靈的能力。
8259,既是這樣﹐求我主﹐使我忠誠走窄路﹔
8260,除去雄心和自負﹐只願順服並受苦。
8261,更大能力我不取﹐更深的死我所需﹔
8262,但願加略的意義﹐完全成功在我軀。
8263,"Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone, can turn our hearts from sin;"
8264,His pow'r alone can sanctify and keep us pure within.
8265,"O Spirit of faith and love, come in our midst, we pray,"
8266,And purify each seeking heart; baptize us with pow'r today.
8267,"Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone can deeper love inspire;"
8268,His power alone within our souls can light the sacred fire.
8269,"Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can bring the gifts we seek in prayer;"
8270,His voice can words of comfort speak and still each wave of care.
8271,"Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can give the grace we need this hour;"
8272,"And while we wait, O Spirit, come in sanctifying power."
8273,"O Spirit of love, descend, come in our midst, we pray,"
8274,"And like a rushing, mighty wind sweep over our souls today."
8275,我主﹐只有祢的聖靈﹐能救我心脫罪﹔
8276,只有祂的能力﹐能清裏面所有污穢。
8277,求用聖靈施憐憫﹐作工在我裏面﹔
8278,潔淨每個等候的心﹐賜下能力作恩典。
8279,我主﹐只有祢的聖靈能生更深的愛﹔
8280,只有祂的能力﹐能令這個聖火燒開。
8281,求用聖靈施憐憫﹐作工在我裏面﹐
8282,我主﹐只有祢的聖靈﹐能賜所求恩賜﹔
8283,只有祂能安慰苦情﹐祂能平靜憂思。
8284,"我主﹐只有祢的聖靈,能賜所需恩惠﹔"
8285,正當我們等候命令﹐祢來聖別充沛。
8286,好像五旬靈風吹臨﹐今日吹進我心坎。
8287,"God sent His mighty pow'r, to this poor sinful heart,"
8288,"To keep me every hour, and needful grace impart;"
8289,"And since His Spirit came to take supreme control,"
8290,The love-enkindled flame is burning in my soul.
8291,"'Tis burning in my soul, 'tis burning in my soul;"
8292,The fire of heav'nly love is burning in my soul.
8293,"The Holy Spirit came, all glory to His name!"
8294,"Before the cross I bow, upon the altar lay"
8295,"A willing off'ring now, my all from day to day."
8296,My Saviour paid the price; my name He sweetly calls.
8297,Upon the sacrifice the fire from heaven falls.
8298,"No good that I have done, His promise I embrace;"
8299,"Accepted in the Son, He saves me by His grace."
8300,All glory be to God! let hallelujahs roll;
8301,"His love is shed abroad, the fire is in my soul."
8302,神賜祂的能力﹐在我窮苦心內﹐
8303,時刻保守提挈﹐灌以必需恩惠﹔
8304,藉靈住我裏面﹐掌管我的全人﹐
8305,用愛發出火焰﹐在我心內直焚。
8306,焚燒在我心內﹐焚燒在我心內﹐
8307,愛焰自天傾下﹐焚燒在我心內﹔
8308,聖靈已來保惠﹐主名應當讚美﹐
8309,愛焰自天傾下﹐焚燒在我心內﹗
8310,我在架下低頭﹐我在壇上奉獻﹔
8311,此生一切所有﹐都呈我主腳前。
8312,祂為我付贖價﹐祂召我得安息﹔
8313,祂使天火降下﹐悅納我的活祭。
8314,我無任何功行﹐惟有神的應許﹔
8315,我藉愛子受刑﹐蒙恩作神兒女。
8316,榮耀歸於我神﹐哈利路亞﹗阿們﹗
8317,這愛激勵至深﹐如火內心在焚。
8357,"Exalted by Thy Father's hand, Into Thy joyous reign so grand."
8358,"Thy promise filled, Thy Spirit sent; My vessel filled at Thy command."
8359,"Divinely pure, Spirit of Christ, Poured from on high to fill my soul."
8360,"The heav'nly fire is burning bright, Flooding my heart with endless glow."
8361,"Fill Thou my spirit and my soul, Fill Thou my thoughts and my desire."
8362,"Fill Thou my all, my every part, My will I yield in full delight."
8363,'Tis done! Thy Spirit fills my heart! My love for Thee is burning bright.
8364,"My knees do bow, my lips confess: “My will, my all, to Thee I yield.”"
8365,"Arise, my soul! Arise and sing The psalms of triumph to the King."
8366,"In all thy days, with all thy might, From earth to heav'n exalt His name."
8367,祢被父神右手高舉，進入榮耀喜樂騰騰；
8368,歡登寶座應驗應許，差遣聖靈滿我器皿。
8369,榮耀聖潔，耶穌的靈，自天傾下，充滿我心；
8370,天上聖火，內心直焚，無限榮光，溢我心魂。
8371,充滿我靈，充滿我魂，充滿愛好，充滿思想；
8372,充滿全人，每一部分，使我意志，喜樂服降。
8373,成了！祢已藉靈充滿，愛慕之情，如火熒熒；
8374,我膝跪拜，我口承認，俯伏向祢，獻上一生。
8375,起來！我魂，起來！歌唱你的救主得勝詩篇；
8376,盡你有限年日力量，高舉祂名，從地到天。

8409,重擔太重，我不能負！

8487,"My goal is God Himself, not joy, nor peace,"
8488,"Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God;"
8489,"'Tis His to lead me there, not mine, but His,"
8490,"At any cost, dear Lord, by any road!"
8491,"So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,"
8492,And love can trust her Lord to lead her there;
8493,"Upheld by Him, my soul is foll'wing hard"
8494,Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer.

8503,我心所追求乃是神自己﹐
8504,不是樂與安﹐也不是福氣﹔
8505,我能出代價﹐達到這聖地﹐
8506,不是我自己﹐乃是祂恩力。
8507,因信而向前﹐要得神自己﹐
8508,憑愛而跟隨﹐永遠不他依﹔
8509,因祂扶持我﹐我追隨不已﹐
8510,直到神答我最深的禱祈。
8511,雖然這道路有時很困難﹐
8512,雖然這代價常是很重大﹐
8513,但祂最知道我需負何擔﹐
8514,因到神的路必須是直達。
8515,一事我所知﹐祂是我所要﹐
8516,一事我所作﹐祂是我所望﹔

8590,"I want to live above the world,"
8591,Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;

8593,The song of saints on higher ground.
8594,"I want to scale the utmost height,"
8595,And catch a gleam of glory bright;
8596,"But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found,"
8597,"""Lord, lead me on to higher ground."""
8598,我今面向高處直登﹐
8599,天天努力﹐天天上升﹔
8600,在我途中﹐我惟禱祝﹐
8601,使我立足更高之處。
8602,主﹐扶持我﹐使我上升﹐
8603,憑信站立天的高峰﹔
8604,更高生活我已可睹﹐
8605,我心不欲繼續住於
8606,疑惑﹑恐懼充斥之域﹔
8607,雖也有人居此地步﹐
8608,我卻心在更高之處。
8609,我要居住超俗之境﹐
8610,不怕撒但火箭欺凌﹔
8611,憑信我已能以接觸
8612,聖樂傳自更高之處。
8613,我願靠恩登峰造極﹐
8614,在彼瞥見榮耀無比﹔
8615,但我仍然禱告不住﹐
8616,求領我到更高之處。

8618,放下重擔脫貪戀，往前走！
8619,父神召你來成聖，基督是你的得勝，
8620,聖靈作你的功能，往前走！
8621,手莫扶犁向後看，往前走！往前走！
8622,腳莫躊躇中途站，往前走！
8623,仰望耶穌免勞煩，手不下垂，腿不酸，
8624,越往前走越追趕，往前走！
8625,追趕至終不改變，往前走！往前走！
8626,向著標竿直往前，往前走！
8627,往前！直到晨星現，往前！直到國度見
8628,往前！直到得冠冕，往前走！

8771,God has His best things for the few That dare to stand the test;
8772,God has His second choice for those Who will not have His best.
8773,"Give me, O Lord, Thy best things, Let others take the rest;"
8774,"I do not want their good things, For I have got the best."
8775,It is not always open ill That risks the promised rest;
8776,The better often is the foe That keeps us from the best.
8777,There's scarcely one but vaguely wants In some way to be blest;
8778,"'Tis not Thy blessing, Lord, I seek, I want Thy very best."
8779,"And others make the highest choice, But when by trials pressed,"
8780,"They shrink, they yield, they shun the Cross, And so they lose the best."
8781,"I want, in this short life of mine, As much as can be pressed,"
8782,Of service true for God and man; Help me to be my best.
8783,"I want, among the victor throng, To have my name confessed;"
8784,"And hear my Master say at last, “Well done, you did your best.”"
8785,為那忍受試驗的人，神給的是至好；
8786,為那不要至好的人，神給的是次好。
8787,求主賜給我至好，讓他人選次好；
8788,他們好處我不要，因我已得至寶。
8789,喪失應許安息之由，往往不是艱勞；
8790,次好事物常成我仇，使我難得至好。
8791,哪裡有人不要祝福，絲毫祝福不要？
8792,但我不求祢的祝福，我只要祢至好。
8793,至上揀選也有人要，但當試煉來到–
8794,畏縮、妥協、十架脫逃，至好，跟著丟掉。
8795,我要趁此年日短少，盡其壓迫臨到；
8796,忠於職守讓主稱道，助我達到至好。
8797,得勝群眾當主點校，我要有分點召；
8798,且聽救主慈聲說道：“你已力求至好。”
8816,"Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,"
8817,I want Thee forever to live in my soul;
8818,"Break down ev'ry idol, cast out ev'ry foe,"
8819,"Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."
8820,"Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow,"
8821,"Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain,"
8822,Apply Thine own blood and extract ev'ry stain;
8823,"To get this blest cleansing I all things forego,"
8824,"Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,"
8825,And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
8826,"I give up myself and whatever I know,"
8827,"Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;"
8828,"I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;"
8829,"By faith, for my cleansing, I see Thy blood flow,"
8830,"Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;"
8831,"Come now, and within me a new heart create;"
8832,"To those who have sought Thee, Thou never saidst No;"
8833,主耶穌﹐我真羨慕能得完全﹐
8834,我要祢時刻活在我的魂間﹔
8835,粉碎眾偶像﹐驅逐所有失敗﹐
8836,求主洗淨我﹐使我比雪更白。
8837,比雪更白﹐是﹐比雪更白﹐
8838,"主耶穌﹐不要讓有""不聖""遺留﹐"
8839,求用祢寶血﹐除去所有污垢﹔
8840,我為得聖潔﹐一切都願割愛﹐
8841,主耶穌﹐求從天上寶座垂憐﹐
8842,助我獻完全的祭在祢面前﹔
8843,我放下自己和我所有障礙﹐
8844,主耶穌﹐為此﹐我今謙卑祈求﹐
8845,在十字架下﹐我已等候很久﹔
8846,祢所流寶血﹐我今完全信賴﹐
8847,主耶穌﹐祢已看見我在求尋﹐
8848,求祢今就來﹐賜給一個清心﹔
8849,凡向祢求的﹐祢永不會不睬﹐
8850,"Thou hidden love of God, whose height,"
8851,"Whose depth unfathom'd no man knows,"
8852,"I see from far Thy beauteous light,"
8853,In-ly I sigh for Thy repose;
8854,"My heart is pained, nor can it be"
8855,"At rest, till it finds rest in Thee."
8856,Thy secret voice invites me still
8857,The sweetness of Thy yoke to prove;
8858,"And fain I would, but though my will"
8859,"Seems fixed, yet wide my passions rove;"
8860,Yet hindrances strew all the way;
8861,"I aim at Thee, yet from Thee stray."
8862,"'Tis mercy all, that Thou hast brought"
8863,My mind to seek her peace in Thee;
8864,"Yet, while I seek but find Thee not,"
8865,No peace my wand'ring soul shall see.
8866,"Oh, when shall all my wand'rings end"
8867,And all my steps to Thee-ward tend!
8868,Is there a thing beneath the sun
8869,That strives with Thee my heart to share?
8870,"Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone,"
8871,The Lord of every motion there.
8872,"Then shall my heart from earth be free,"
8873,When it has found repose in Thee.
8874,"Oh, hide this self from me, that I"
8875,"No more, but Christ in me may live;"
8876,"My vile affections mortify,"
8877,Nor let one darling sin survive.
8878,"In all things nothing may I see,"
8879,Nothing desire or seek but Thee.
8880,"O Lord, Thy sovereign aid impart,"
8881,To save me from low-thoughted care;
8882,Chase this self-will through all my heart
8883,Through all its latent mazes there.
8884,"Make me Thy duteous child, that I"
8885,"Ceaseless may Abba, Father, cry."
8886,Each moment draw from earth away
8887,My heart which lowly waits Thy call;
8888,"Speak to my inmost soul and say,"
8889,"""I am thy love, thy God, thy all."""
8890,"To feel Thy power, to hear Thy voice,"
8891,"To taste Thy love, be all my choice."
8892,祢這神的隱藏的愛﹐
8893,長闊高深﹐無人知悉﹔
8894,遠遠我見祢的光采﹐
8895,我就歎息望得安息﹔
8896,我心痛苦﹐不能安息﹐
8897,除非我心安息於祢。
8898,祢的聲音﹐仍然隱招
8899,我來負祢甜美的軛﹔
8900,我雖幾乎前來應召﹐
8901,但是懼怕前途阻隔﹔
8902,我志雖定﹐我情卻離﹐
8903,我欲向祢﹐反而背祢。
8904,全是恩典！使祢吸引
8905,我心向祢追求安息﹔
8906,我雖追求﹐不能親近﹐
8907,流蕩的我無所憑依﹔
8908,哦﹐要何時不再流蕩﹐
8909,所有腳踪向祢而往﹖
8910,日下有無甚麼東西﹐
8911,與祢相爭來分我心﹖
8912,呀﹐我求祢把它割棄﹐
8913,讓祢作王無人與競﹔
8914,我心纔會不再拘泥﹐
8915,當它藉祢得了安息。
8916,哦﹐我求祢埋藏這己﹐
8917,使主(非我)從我而活﹗
8918,惡慾邪情釘死絕跡﹐
8919,不私留一寶貝罪惡﹔
8920,除祢之外﹐在凡事上﹐
8921,使我無求﹐使我無望。
8922,哦﹐主﹐給我無上之助﹐
8923,救我脫離無用之慮﹔
8924,趕出己意離我心府﹐
8925,離我全人隱密之域﹔
8926,使我作個順命的人﹐
8927,不斷稱頌﹐時常感恩。
8928,求祢使我時刻離地﹐
8929,謙卑等候聽祢吩咐﹔
8930,求祢對我時常題起﹕
8931,“我是你愛、你命、你主。”
8932,來聽祢聲﹐來覺祢力﹐
8933,來嘗祢愛﹐是我所期。

9034,脫離捆綁、憂愁與黑影﹐
9035,耶穌﹐我來﹗耶穌﹐我來﹗
9036,進入自由、喜樂與光明﹐
9037,耶穌﹐我來就祢﹗

9051,脫離幽暗可怕的死亡﹐
9052,進入光明歡樂的家鄉﹐
9053,脫離敗壞無底的深淵﹐
9054,進入護庇安歇的羊圈﹔
9055,永永遠遠瞻仰祢榮顏﹐
9062,"I gave my life for thee; My precious blood I shed,"
9063,That thou might'st ransomed be and quickened from the dead.
9064,"For thee, for thee, I gave my life; what hast thou giv'n for Me?"
9065,"I spent long years for thee in weariness and woe,"
9066,That an eternity of joy thou mightest know.
9067,"For thee, for thee, I spent long years; hast thou spent one for Me?"
9068,"My Father's house of light, My rainbow circled throne,"
9069,"I left for earthly night, for wand'rings sad and lone."
9070,"For thee, for thee, I left it all; hast thou left aught for Me?"
9071,"I suffer'd much for thee — more than thy tongue can tell,"
9072,Of bitt'rest agony to rescue thee from hell.
9073,"For thee, for thee, I suffer'd much; what canst thou bear for Me?"
9074,"And I have brought to thee down from My home above,"
9075,"Salvation full and free, My pardon and My love."
9076,"To thee, to thee, great gifts I brought; what hast thou brought to Me?"
9077,"Lord, let my life be given and every moment spent,"
9078,"For God, for souls, for heav'n, and all earth's ties be rent."
9079,"For me, for me, Thou gavest Thyself; now I give all for Thee."
9080,為你﹐我捨生命﹐為你﹐我流寶血﹔
9081,將你洗得潔淨﹐使你與神和諧。
9082,為你﹐為你﹐我捨生命﹐為我﹐你捨甚情﹖
9083,為你﹐我費多年﹐憂患苦難遍嘗﹐
9084,好使快樂永遠﹐你也得以安享。
9085,為你﹐為你﹐我費多年﹐為我﹐你費幾天﹖
9086,我父光明之家﹐我的榮耀寶座﹐
9087,為你﹐我都撇下﹐來到此地漂泊。
9088,為你﹐為你﹐我撇這些﹐為我﹐你何所撇﹖
9089,為你﹐我受痛苦﹐過於你口能述﹔
9090,受了極大辛楚﹐救你脫離陰府。
9091,為你﹐為你﹐苦受許多﹐為我﹐你受甚麼﹖
9092,為你﹐我從天家﹐為你﹐我已帶來：
9093,救恩無以復加﹐赦免、自由、慈愛。
9094,為你﹐為你﹐我帶許多﹐你帶甚麼給我﹖
9095,主﹐我獻上生命﹐和我所有時間﹐
9096,完全聽祢使令﹐脫離己的鎖鍊。
9097,為我﹐為我﹐祢的全休﹔為祢﹐我棄所有。
9161,"Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?"
9162,Is not thine a captured heart?
9163,"As the fairest of thousands own Him,"
9164,Joyful choose the better part?
9165,Thou art the fairest of thousands to me;
9166,"Seize Thou my heart, cause my blind eyes to see."
9167,"Crushing all idols, with joy I crown Thee"
9168,As the fairest of thousands to me.
9169,"Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,"
9170,Lovely things of time and sense;
9171,"Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,"
9172,Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.
9173,What has stript the seeming beauty
9174,From the idols of the earth?
9175,"Not a sense of right or duty,"
9176,But the sight of peerless worth.
9177,Not the crushing of these idols
9178,With its bitter void and smart;
9179,"But the beaming of His beauty,"
9180,The unveiling of His heart.
9181,Who extinguishes their taper
9182,Till they hail the rising sun?
9183,Who discards the garb of winter
9184,Till the summer has begun?
9185,"'Tis that look that melted Peter,"
9186,"'Tis that face that Stephen saw,"
9187,"'Tis that heart that wept with Mary,"
9188,Can alone from idols draw.
9189,"Draw and win and fill completely,"
9190,Till the cup o'erflow the brim.
9191,What have we to do with idols
9192,Who have companied with Him?
9193,你的靈豈非與祂會過﹖
9194,你的心曾否被祂所奪﹖
9195,是否認祂為人中第一人﹐
9196,歡喜揀選那上好福分﹖
9197,祢是千萬人中之第一人﹗
9198,哦﹐求祢開我眼﹐並奪我心﹔
9199,摔碎眾偶像﹐並歡然加冠-
9200,祢為千萬人中之第一人﹗
9201,世界的一切虛榮、珍寶﹐
9202,盡都是偶像﹐使人顛倒﹔
9203,鍍過金﹐使人不容易淡泊﹐
9204,浸過蜜﹐使人真難超脫。
9205,是甚麼會使地上偶像﹐
9206,失去它那美麗的模樣﹖
9207,並不是灰心、失望或勸勉﹐
9208,乃是“無價之寶”的一現﹗
9209,並不是甚麼本分催促﹐
9210,就會使偶像化成灰土﹔
9211,乃是祂榮耀、美麗的噴吐﹐
9212,並祂慈愛、溫柔的流露。
9213,有誰願熄滅他的燈火﹐
9214,若非早晨的日已在望﹖
9215,又有誰願意收藏他寒衣﹐
9216,若非炎夏的風已興起﹖
9217,惟有彼得所見的淚眼﹐
9218,司提反所仰望的榮臉﹐
9219,陪著馬利亞同哭的慈心﹐
9220,會使我脫離屬地吸引。
9221,哦﹐求祢大愛將我吸引﹐
9222,直到祢自己充滿這心﹔
9223,我們蒙救贖﹐是祢的同伴﹐
9224,與偶像還有甚麼相干﹖
9225,"Give of your best to the Master,"
9226,Give of the strength of your youth;
9227,"Throw your soul's fresh, glowing ardor,"
9228,Into the battle for truth.
9229,Jesus has set the example;
9230,"Dauntless was He, young and brave;"
9231,"Give Him your loyal devotion,"
9232,Give Him the best that you have.
9233,"Clad in salvation's full armor,"
9234,Join in the battle for truth.
9235,Give Him first place in your heart;
9236,"Give Him first place in your service,"
9237,Consecrate every part.
9238,"Give, and to you will be given —"
9239,God His beloved Son gave;
9240,"Gratefully seeking to serve Him,"
9241,Naught else is worthy His love;
9242,"He gave Himself for your ransom,"
9243,Gave up His glory above;
9244,"Laid down His life without murmur,"
9245,You from sin's ruin to save;
9246,"Give Him your heart's adoration,"
9247,將你最好的獻與主﹐
9248,獻你年輕的力量﹗
9249,孤注一擲熱情蓬勃﹐
9250,勇敢赴真理戰場﹗
9251,主耶穌留下好榜樣﹐
9252,忠誠堅定不懼怕﹔
9253,你要忠心全心愛祂﹐
9254,將你最好獻與主。
9255,穿上救恩全副軍裝﹐
9256,主在你心居首位﹔
9257,支配你一切的事奉﹐
9258,每部分因主成聖。
9259,神既捨棄祂的愛子﹐
9260,給主﹐主必全給你﹔
9261,恩何大﹐懇求來服事﹐
9262,主愛浩大無可比﹔
9263,離開天上榮耀居所﹐
9264,將自己作你贖價。
9265,祂捨生命毫無怨言﹐
9266,拯救我滅亡罪人﹔
9267,獻上自己作為敬拜﹐
9268,將你最好獻與主﹗
9273,"Living for Jesus a life that is true,"
9274,"Striving to please Him in all that I do,"
9275,"Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,"
9276,This is the pathway of blessing for me.
9277,"O Jesus, Lord and Saviour, I give myself to Thee;"
9278,"For Thou in Thy atonement, didst give Thyself for me;"
9279,"I own no other Master, my heart shall be Thy throne."
9280,"My life I give henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone."
9281,"Living for Jesus who died in my place,"
9282,"Bearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace,"
9283,"Such love constrains me to answer His call,"
9284,Follow His leading and give Him my all.
9285,"Living for Jesus wherever I am,"
9286,"Doing each duty in His holy name,"
9287,"Willing to suffer affliction and loss,"
9288,Deeming each trial a part of my cross.
9289,"Living for Jesus thro' earth's little while,"
9290,"My dearest treasure, the light of His smile,"
9291,"Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,"
9292,Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.
9293,活著為耶穌﹐只望能單純﹐
9294,所有的一切都求祂喜悅﹔
9295,自動並樂意來向祂投順﹐
9296,這是我蒙神賜福的祕訣。
9297,耶穌我主﹐我救主﹐我將自己給祢﹔
9298,因祢為我代死時﹐給的是祢自己﹔
9299,從此﹐我無別的主﹐我心是祢寶座﹐
9300,我的一生一世﹐基督﹐只要為祢生活。
9301,活著為耶穌﹐祂為我緣故﹐
9302,在十字架上擔當罪與羞﹔
9303,這愛激勵我答應祂召呼﹐
9304,恭敬向著祂奉獻我所有。
9305,活著為耶穌﹐無論在何處﹐
9306,我為祂緣故﹐作成祂事務﹔
9307,甘願來承受損失或痛苦﹐
9308,看每個試煉是十架一部。
9309,活著為耶穌﹐時間已短促﹐
9310,祂的笑臉是我寶貴秘密﹔
9311,尋找失喪者﹐祂死所救贖﹐
9312,帶領疲倦者享受祂安息。
9357,"Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;"
9358,My heart by mighty grace compell'd
9359,Surrenders all to Thee;
9360,"Against Thy terrors long I strove,"
9361,But who can stand against Thy love?
9362,Love conquers even me.
9363,"If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,"
9364,"And light'nings flash to blast my soul,"
9365,I still had stubborn been;
9366,"But mercy has my heart subdued,"
9367,"A bleeding Saviour I have viewed,"
9368,And now I hate my sin.
9369,"Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,"
9370,"Come, take possession of Thine own,"
9371,For Thou hast set me free;
9372,"Released from Satan's hard command,"
9373,"See all my powers waiting stand,"
9374,To be employed by Thee.
9375,主﹐祢得勝﹐我今服矣﹗
9376,恩典強迫我的心意﹐
9377,奉獻一切於祢﹔
9378,祢的可怕我能久排﹐
9379,但誰能抗祢的大愛﹖
9380,愛大﹐我無能力。
9381,祢若命祢萬鈞雷霆﹐
9382,轟我靈魂向我施刑﹐
9383,我仍固執不悔﹔
9384,但是憐憫征服我心﹐
9385,以往抵擋銷化淨盡﹐
9386,現今我恨我罪﹗
9387,我今羨慕單獨歸祢﹐
9388,主﹐來佔領這個陋器﹐
9389,作為祢的所有﹔
9390,我既脫離撒但暴手﹐
9391,就願全人毫無保留﹐
9392,服事祢到永久。
9493,How shall I follow Him I serve?
9494,How shall I copy Him I love?
9495,"Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve,"
9496,Which lead me to His seat above?
9497,"Lord, should my path through suffering lie,"
9498,Forbid that I should e'er repine;
9499,"Still let me turn to Calvary,"
9500,"Nor heed my griefs, remembering Thine."
9501,"O, let me think how Thou didst leave"
9502,"Untasted every pure delight,"
9503,"To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,"
9504,"Through toilsome days, through homeless nights."
9505,"To faint, to grieve, to die for me!"
9506,Thou camest not Thyself to please;
9507,"And, dear though earthly comforts be,"
9508,Shall I not love Thee more than these?
9509,"Yes! I would count them all but loss,"
9510,To gain the notice of Thine eye.
9511,"Flesh shrinks and trembles at the cross,"
9512,But Thou canst give the victory.
9513,我當如何愛我的主﹖
9514,如何奉獻使祂歡喜﹖
9515,不稍離開祂的道路﹐
9516,學習如何與祂親密。
9517,我的途徑若是痛苦﹐
9518,主﹐我求祢禁我退縮﹔
9519,使我仍然向祢順服﹐
9520,追憶祢的十架重負。
9521,讓我思念祢曾如何
9522,離開許多純潔樂事﹐
9523,來憂﹐來餓﹐來倦﹐來渴﹐
9524,無家之夜﹐不息之日。
9525,為我來憂﹐來倦﹐來死﹐
9526,祢來不求自己喜悅﹔
9527,地上安逸雖難恝置﹐
9528,我豈愛祢不勝這些﹖
9529,是的﹐我算萬事為損﹐
9530,為要來得祢的注意﹔
9531,丟棄萬事雖如土糞﹐
9532,為著愛祢有何可惜﹖
9537,Am I a soldier of the Cross —
9538,A follow'r of the Lamb?
9539,"And shall I fear to own His cause,"
9540,Or blush to speak His name?
9541,"In the name, the precious name"
9542,"Of Him who died for me,"
9543,"Thro' grace I'll win the promised crown,"
9544,Whate'er my cross may be!
9545,Must I be carried to the skies
9546,"On flow'ry beds of ease,"
9547,While others fought to win the prize
9548,And sailed through bloody seas?
9549,Are there no foes for me to face?
9550,Must I not stem the flood?
9551,"Is this vile world a friend to grace,"
9552,To help me on to God?
9553,"Sure, I must fight if I would reign;"
9554,"Increase my courage, Lord."
9555,"I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,"
9556,Supported by Thy word.
9557,我是否要背負十架，
9558,跟從神的羔羊？
9559,我豈可以怕出代價，
9560,要得世界原諒？
9561,因祢名，寶貴的名，
9562,因祢為我捨命；
9563,靠恩，無論如何艱難，
9564,我要求祢喜歡。
9565,別人苦戰要得榮耀﹐
9566,血汗滿被沙場﹔
9567,我豈可以安坐花轎﹐
9568,盼望抬進天堂？
9569,難道我無仇敵當拒？
9570,我無破口當堵？
9571,難道俗世也可相與？
9572,也可作我幫助？
9573,我要掌權﹐就得爭戰﹐
9574,哦主﹐加我力量﹔
9575,我願受辱﹐我不畏難﹐
9576,靠祢話語剛強。
9604,"Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,"
9605,By His presence all divine?
9606,"True and tender, pure and precious,"
9607,O how blest to call Him mine!
9608,"All that thrills my soul is Jesus,"
9609,He is more than life to me;
9610,"And the fairest of ten thousand,"
9611,In my blessed Lord I see.
9612,"Love of Christ so freely given,"
9613,"Grace of God beyond degree,"
9614,"Mercy higher than the heaven,"
9615,Deeper than the deepest sea.
9616,What a wonderful redemption!
9617,Never can a mortal know
9618,"How my sin, tho' red like crimson,"
9619,Can be whiter than the snow.
9620,"Ev'ry need His hand supplying,"
9621,Ev'ry good in Him I see;
9622,"On His strength divine relying,"
9623,He is all in all to me.
9624,By the crystal flowing river
9625,"With the ransomed I will sing,"
9626,And forever and forever
9627,Praise and glorify the King.
9628,誰如耶穌樂我心靈﹐
9629,藉祂神聖的同在﹖
9630,信實溫柔無限寶貴﹐
9631,何等福分主屬我﹗
9632,惟主耶穌沐我心靈﹐
9633,寶貴遠勝我生命﹐
9634,千萬人中祂最榮美﹐
9635,合當永頌主尊名。
9636,主的大愛何等豐富﹐
9637,主的恩典何難測﹔
9638,主的憐憫高過諸天﹐
9639,最深淵海無可比。
9640,何等奇妙救贖恩功﹐
9641,遠非心思能明白﹔
9642,我眾罪孽雖如硃紅﹐
9643,今白如雪全洗淨。
9644,靠祂神聖大能大力﹐
9645,一切需要供給我﹔
9646,我知祢是眾善源頭﹐
9647,主是萬有我何求。
9648,直到水晶生命河旁﹐
9649,還與贖民同歌唱﹔
9650,此歌何甜唱到永遠﹐
9651,讚美榮耀我君王。
9652,"I'll give my all, Jesus to gain;"
9653,Jesus can satisfy my heart.
9654,He is my soul's very desire;
9655,His peace and joy to me impart.
9656,He is so rich! He is so full!
9657,How can I tell all that I know?
9658,He is so sweet! He is so true!
9659,This I have tasted in my soul.
9660,Jesus alone can thrill my soul.
9661,"Possessing all, I still have need;"
9662,"Possessing Christ, fullness will flow."
9663,Though very great is all the world
9664,"And very small is my own heart,"
9665,Yet this great world with all its wealth
9666,Can fill this small heart but in part.
9667,"When I have Christ, I sing with joy;"
9668,"When I have not, I sigh in woe."
9669,"Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven here;"
9670,"Where He is not, 'tis hell below."
9671,我捨一切而要耶穌﹐
9672,耶穌滿足我全心﹔
9673,耶穌何等可以羨慕﹐
9674,使我平安並歡欣。
9675,祂的豐滿我不能言！
9676,但這豐滿我知道﹔
9677,祂的自己真是甘甜！
9678,而這甘甜我嘗到。
9679,有了耶穌我心愉﹔
9680,得著一切仍是不足﹐
9681,得著耶穌就有餘。
9682,世界雖大﹐我心雖小﹐
9683,大者難使小者富﹔
9684,小小之心所有需要﹐
9685,惟有耶穌能滿足。
9686,有了耶穌我能歡唱﹐
9687,沒有耶穌我憂鬱﹔
9688,耶穌同在就是天堂﹐
9689,耶穌不在是地獄。
9698,"I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,"
9699,I'd rather be His than have riches untold;
9700,"I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands,"
9701,I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.
9702,"Than to be the king of a vast domain,"
9703,And be held in sin's dread sway;
9704,"I'd rather have Jesus than anything,"
9705,This world affords today.
9706,"I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause,"
9707,I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;
9708,"I'd rather have Jesus than world wide fame,"
9709,I'd rather be true to His holy name.
9710,"He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,"
9711,He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;
9712,"He's all that my hungering spirit needs,"
9713,I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead.
9714,我寧願有耶穌﹐勝於金銀﹐
9715,我寧屬耶穌﹐勝過財富無邊﹔
9716,我寧願有耶穌﹐勝過地土﹐
9717,願主釘痕手引導我前途。
9718,勝過作君王﹐雖統治萬方﹐
9719,卻仍受罪惡捆綁﹔
9720,我寧願有耶穌﹐勝於世上
9721,榮華、富貴、聲望。
9722,我寧願有耶穌﹐勝於稱揚﹐
9723,我寧忠於主﹐滿足主的心腸﹔
9724,我寧願有耶穌﹐勝於美名﹐
9725,願對主忠誠﹐宣揚主聖名。
9726,祂是美中最美﹐遠勝百合﹐
9727,祂是甜中甜﹐遠勝蜂房滴蜜﹐
9728,祂是一切一切﹐餵我饑靈﹔
9729,寧願有耶穌﹐跟隨祂率領。
9867,Thy name is sweet as ointment poured forth;
9868,Better Thy love than wine. O draw Thou me!
9869,"If we but trace the footsteps of the flock,"
9870,Brought in Thy fellowship of love we'll be.
9871,"He's my Beloved, I am His own love;"
9872,"He draweth me, pursue I after Him."
9873,"Fragrant as myrrh, I'd hide Him in my heart;"
9874,"Beauteous as henna, I'd be clothed with Him."
9875,"Bathe in His love, and of His fatness taste,"
9876,"Lie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;"
9877,"His love the banner, His affection shown"
9878,Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.
9879,"Oh, my Beloved's mine, and I am His;"
9880,I am a lily and my Shepherd He;
9881,"May daybreak come, the shadows flee away,"
9882,Him on the mountains as a hart I'd see.
9883,"Come Thou, with myrrh of death and frankincense"
9884,"Of resurrection, permeate my heart;"
9885,"Awake, O north wind, let the south wind come"
9886,Make my heart's garden pleasant to His heart.
9887,"I'd be to Him a dove that's undefiled,"
9888,"As a pure lily in His presence be,"
9889,"His, wholly His, the joy of all His joys,"
9890,"He wholly mine, the Song of songs to me."
9891,"Fair as the moon, conformed to Him I'd be,"
9892,"Clear as the sun, unto His stature grown;"
9893,"For my Beloved, all to please His heart,"
9894,"For my Beloved, that His life be shown."
9895,"Thou art my life, and I Thine image real;"
9896,"Love in such union is as death most strong,"
9897,Ne'er can it be destroyed or e'er replaced
9898,Till Thou on mounts of spices come ere long.
9899,祢名似膏香﹐祢愛比酒美﹐
9900,祢若來吸引﹐有誰不跟隨﹖
9901,我們若跟隨羊群的腳蹤﹐
9902,我們必進入祢愛的交通。
9903,祂是我良人﹐我是祂佳偶﹐
9904,祂將我吸引﹐我將祂追求﹔
9905,祂香如沒藥﹐我願藏心房﹐
9906,祂美似鳳仙﹐我願戴身上。
9907,進入祂愛裏﹐享受祂肥甘﹐
9908,躺在祂懷中﹐飽嘗祂香甜﹔
9909,祂愛為旌旗﹐將我身遮藏﹐
9910,祂情似美物﹐使我心舒暢。
9911,良人屬於我﹐我也屬於祂﹐
9912,祂是牧養者﹐我是百合花。
9913,惟願天快曙﹐黑影全飛散﹐
9914,見祂如朝鹿﹐顯在比特山。
9915,同死的沒藥﹐復活的乳香﹐
9916,來將我薰透﹐好給祂欣賞﹔
9917,北風阿﹐興起﹔南風阿﹐吹來﹐
9918,來使我心園﹐成為祂心愛。
9919,願在祂眼中﹐美麗如良鴿﹐
9920,願在祂面前﹐皎潔似百合﹔
9921,願我全屬祂﹐作祂樂中樂﹐
9922,像祂全屬我﹐是我歌中歌。
9923,美麗如月亮﹐得有祂形像﹐
9924,光明似太陽﹐得有祂身量﹔
9925,全屬我良人﹐使祂命顯彰﹐
9926,全為我良人﹐使祂心舒暢。
9927,祢是我生命﹐我是祢活像﹐
9928,愛情的聯結﹐如死之堅強﹐
9929,無何能消滅﹐無何能替換﹐
9930,直到祢顯現﹐在那香草山。
9931,"The Lord's our rock, in Him we hide,"
9932,A shelter in the time of storm;
9933,"Secure whatever ill betide,"
9934,A shelter in the time of storm.
9935,"Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,"
9936,"A weary land, a weary land;"
9937,"Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land!"
9938,"A shade by day, defense by night,"
9939,"No fears alarm, no foes affright,"
9940,"The raging storms may round us beat,"
9941,"We'll never leave our safe retreat,"
9942,"O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,"
9943,"Be Thou our helper ever near,"
9944,主是磐石容我藏躲﹐
9945,暴風雨中之避難所﹔
9946,災禍來臨我得穩妥﹐
9947,暴風雨中之避難所。
9948,主耶穌是磐石﹐我之避難所﹐
9949,如沙漠地﹐有蔭涼所﹔
9950,日間遮蔭﹐夜間保護﹐
9951,無事可驚﹐無敵可怖﹐
9952,狂風暴雨四面來襲﹐
9953,我們絕不離開蔭蔽﹐
9954,神聖磐石﹐親密隱處﹐
9955,一旦有難﹐作我幫助﹐
9956,"A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord,"
9957,A wonderful Saviour to me;
9958,"He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,"
9959,Where rivers of pleasure I see.
9960,"That shadows a dry, thirsty land;"
9961,"He hideth my life in the depths of His love,"
9962,"And covers me there with His hand,"
9963,And covers me there with His hand.
9964,"A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord,"
9965,He taketh my burden away;
9966,"He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,"
9967,He giveth me strength as my day.
9968,"With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,"
9969,"And, filled with His fullness divine,"
9970,"I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,"
9971,For such a Redeemer as mine!
9972,"When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise"
9973,"To meet Him in clouds of the sky,"
9974,"His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,"
9975,I'll shout with the millions on high.
9976,何等奇妙救主是耶穌我主﹐
9977,祂是我的奇妙救主！
9978,祂隱藏我魂在磐石的穴中﹐
9979,那裡我見樂泉湧流。
9980,蔭庇乾旱疲乏之地﹔
9981,祂將我生命藏祂愛的深處﹐
9982,又用祂聖手來遮蔽﹐
9983,又用祂聖手來遮蔽。
9984,"何等奇妙救主是耶穌我主,"
9985,祂背去我一切重負﹔
9986,祂用手緊握住使我不搖動﹐
9987,一生賜我力量無窮。
9988,時刻祂以無窮恩典為冠冕﹐
9989,以祂豐滿溢我心中﹔
9990,當我被提時﹐我要歌唱歡呼﹕
9991,何等奇妙我主我神！
9992,復活變化我以祂光明為衣﹐
9993,與祂相遇空中雲外﹔
9994,與億萬眾聖唱在穹蒼高處﹐
9995,一同喊出祂愛無窮。
9996,一同喊出祂愛無窮﹔
9997,我願將全人仍藏祂深愛中﹐
9998,仍由祂聖手來遮蔽﹐
9999,仍由祂聖手來遮蔽。
10009,"Abiding, oh, so wondrous sweet!"
10010,I'm resting at the Saviour's feet;
10011,"I trust in Him; I'm satisfied,"
10012,I'm resting in the Crucified!
10013,"Abiding, abiding, Oh, how wondrous sweet!"
10014,"I'm resting, resting, At the Saviour's feet."
10015,住在主裏﹐何等甘甜﹗
10016,我今安息救主腳前﹔
10017,完全信靠﹐完全滿足﹐
10018,安息在於受死的主。
10019,在主裏﹐在主裏﹐哦﹐何等甘甜﹗
10020,我安息﹐安息在救主腳前。
10021,In the secret of His presence
10022,How my soul delights to hide!
10023,"Oh, how precious are the lessons"
10024,Which I learn at Jesus' side!
10025,"Earthly cares can never vex me,"
10026,Neither trials lay me low;
10027,"For when Satan comes to tempt me,"
10028,"To the secret place I go,"
10029,To the secret place I go.
10030,"When my soul is faint and thirsty,"
10031,'Neath the shadow of His wing
10032,"There is cool and pleasant shelter,"
10033,And a fresh and crystal spring;
10034,"And my Saviour rests beside me,"
10035,As we hold communion sweet;
10036,"If I tried, I could not utter"
10037,"What He says when thus we meet,"
10038,What He says when thus we meet.
10039,Only this I know; I tell Him
10040,All my doubts and griefs and fears;
10041,"Oh, how patiently He listens!"
10042,And my drooping soul He cheers;
10043,Do you think He ne'er reproves me?
10044,"What a false friend He would be,"
10045,"If He never, never told me"
10046,Of the sins which He must see!
10047,Would you like to know that sweetness
10048,Of the secret of the Lord?
10049,Go and hide beneath His shadow;
10050,This shall then be your reward;
10051,And whene'er you leave the silence
10052,"Of that happy meeting-place,"
10053,By the Spirit bear the image
10054,"Of the Master in your face,"
10055,Of the Master in your face.
10056,在祂同在的隱密處﹐
10057,我得安居何甘美﹗
10058,在祂面前時常俯伏﹐
10059,所學功課何寶貴﹗
10060,憂慮不能將我攪擾﹐
10061,試煉也不能壓住﹔
10062,每逢撒但引誘吼叫﹐
10063,我就到祂隱密處﹐
10064,我就到祂隱密處。
10065,當我帶著疲倦、乾渴﹐
10066,來到祂的翅膀間﹐
10067,就得蔭庇﹐涼爽、快樂﹐
10068,活泉清澈而新鮮﹔
10069,在此投身救主胸懷﹐
10070,彼此交通滿香甜﹐
10071,我雖嘗試﹐也說不來﹐
10072,祂那祕密的語言﹐
10073,祂那祕密的語言。
10074,但有一事是我所知﹕
10075,當我向祂訴苦情﹐
10076,祂就耐心聽我心事﹐
10077,並且鼓舞我萎靈﹔
10078,你想從來祂不責備﹖
10079,那祂就是很虛偽﹐
10080,如果祂是從來也未
10081,責備祂所見的罪﹐
10082,責備祂所見的罪。
10083,這隱密處如何美佳﹐
10084,如果你也願知曉﹐
10085,請去住在祂的蔭下﹐
10086,就必嘗到這味道﹔
10087,若你的靈與祂相交﹐
10088,安靜住於祂榮光﹐
10089,你的臉面就必反照
10090,祂那榮美的形像﹐
10091,祂那榮美的形像。
10107,"When we walk with the Lord in the light of His word,"
10108,What a glory He sheds on our way!
10109,"While we do His good will, He abides with us still"
10110,And with all who will trust and obey!
10111,Trust and obey! For there's no other way
10112,To be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.
10113,"Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,"
10114,But His smile quickly drives it away;
10115,"Not a doubt nor a fear, not a sigh nor a tear"
10116,Can abide while we trust and obey.
10117,"Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,"
10118,But our toil He doth richly repay;
10119,"Not a grief nor a loss, not a frown nor a cross,"
10120,But is blest if we trust and obey.
10121,"But we never can prove, the delights of His love"
10122,Until all on the altar we lay;
10123,"For the favour He shows, and the joy He bestows,"
10124,Are for them who will trust and obey.
10125,"Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet,"
10126,"Or we'll walk by His side in the way,"
10127,"What He says we will do, where He sends we will go —"
10128,"Never fear, only trust and obey!"
10129,當我與主同行﹐在祂話語光中﹐
10130,何等榮耀照亮我路程﹔
10131,當我肯聽命令﹐祂就充滿我靈﹐
10132,祂充滿信而順從的人。
10133,信而順從﹗因為除此以外﹐
10134,不能得主的喜愛-惟有信而順從。
10135,地無一點黑影﹐天無一片烏雲﹐
10136,能迷漫﹐當祂笑容顯露﹔
10137,沒有疑惑畏懼﹐沒有流淚憂慮﹐
10138,能存在﹐若我信而順從。
10139,沒有一個重擔﹐沒有一點為難﹐
10140,祂是不顧﹐讓我們痛苦﹔
10141,所有傷心損失﹐所有厭棄羞恥
10142,都成祝福﹐若信而順從。
10143,但我不能領會祂愛何等的美﹐
10144,若我不放一切於祭壇﹔
10145,因祂所給詩歌﹐因祂所賜喜樂﹐
10146,乃是為肯信而順從者。
10147,然後﹐我纔會在祂的腳前往來﹐
10148,我就傍祂而同行前路﹔
10149,祂要求﹐我就許﹐祂差遣﹐我就去﹐
10150,不要怕﹐只要信而順從。
10238,"Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;"
10239,"Thou art the Potter, I am the clay."
10240,"Mould me and make me after Thy will,"
10241,"While I am waiting, yielded and still."
10242,"Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!"
10243,"Search me and try me, Master, today."
10244,"Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,"
10245,As in Thy presence humbly I bow.
10246,"Wounded and weary; help me, I pray."
10247,"Power, all power, surely is Thine,"
10248,"Touch me and heal me, Saviour Divine."
10249,"Free from myself, Lord, for this I pray."
10250,"Break me and strip me, that ""I"" be nil;"
10251,"Empty and purge me, that I be clean."
10252,Hold o'er my being absolute sway.
10253,Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see
10254,"Christ only, always, living in me."
10255,隨祢調度﹐主﹐隨祢調度﹔
10256,因祢是陶人﹐我是泥土。
10257,當我正等候﹐又軟又弱﹐
10258,求照祢旨意﹐摶我造我。
10259,當我在祢前謙卑俯伏。
10260,求祢來鑒察﹐並加選擇﹔
10261,求祢將我洗﹐比雪更白。
10262,受傷又疲倦﹐求祢扶助。
10263,能力全能力﹐完全屬祢﹔
10264,摸我並撫我﹐使我得醫。
10265,完全脫自己﹐是我所慕。
10266,破碎又剝奪﹐使我成零﹔
10267,挖空並倒空﹐使我乾淨。
10268,深願我全人向祢順服。
10269,用靈充滿我﹐使人看見
10270,只有、永有祢﹐從我彰顯。
10271,我為基督而生，苦難使我得益；
10272,背負十架以辱為榮，雖憂仍然樂極。
10273,我願跟隨耶穌，樂行祂的路程；
10274,以弱為能，雖貧猶富，似敗，實是得勝。
10275,雲外有我美家，暫居曠野陋室；
10276,夜宿帳棚，黎明出發，上升日高一日。
10277,遠山露出晨曦，照明一切深谷，
10278,所有黑影速速逃避，天光滿我眼目。
10279,不日行到終點，脫離所有掛牽；
10280,無心在此徘徊流連，急去戴我冠冕。
10284,“父阿，是的！”偉大得勝，父神旨意何等寶貝！
10285,雖為兒子，仍學順從，親手接過祂賜苦杯。
10286,因愛無比飲之如飴，纔知入口滴滴甘美；
10287,雖然我眼難免流淚，我心充滿何等安慰。
10288,“父阿，是的！”何等順服，我心安歇一無怨懟！
10289,親人友朋儘可背離，仇敵逼攻無處逃圍。
10290,救主榮光忽然降臨，有祂同行我心高興；
10291,甜美的愛激勵深沉，難忍壓力消蹤失影。
10292,“父阿，是的！”無比權能，凡祂所許充滿恩惠！
10293,試煉的火雖加七倍，救主能力更無窮盡。
10294,壓迫續增傾逼我身，不過使我更親我神；
10295,忽然我靈向天歡吟，黑暗環境大放光明。
10296,“父阿，是的！”神聖宣明，父手所量沉重福分！
10297,救主呼召充滿我心，“學我樣式效我生命。”
10298,我心慕祂溫柔低微，服主軛下隨主蹤影；
10299,諸天安息心中輝映，當我與主同奔天程。
10308,"If from the right course I depart,"
10309,At once comfort I'd find.
10310,But I remember how my Lord
10311,Did suffer agony.
10312,"I'll utterly forsake this world,"
10313,And sever all the ties.
10314,My path may narrow more and more;
10315,I'm but a pilgrim here.
10316,"Though men may scowl and laugh to scorn,"
10317,I only want His smile.
10318,"Let others fancy outward shows,"
10319,"His ""best"" is my desire."
10320,"Not after greatness do I seek,"
10321,Nor success in this life.
10322,"But humbly I would serve the Lord,"
10323,That day to gain His praise.
10324,I'm daily gazing at the light
10325,"Out of His judgement seat,"
10326,That all my living and my works
10327,May stand the test of fire.
10328,"Let others seek for name and fame,"
10329,"For glory, wealth and friends."
10330,"Let them procure their great success,"
10331,Their followers and praise.
10332,"In solitude and poverty,"
10333,I wish to prosper not;
10334,But faithfully I'll follow Him.
10335,Until I reach the goal.
10336,"I know, while here to earth He came,"
10337,"His only gain was ""death."""
10338,"That's why no other wish have I,"
10339,But with Him to suffer loss.
10340,"Since all my glories lie ahead,"
10341,Now patient I must be.
10342,"I will not go before my Lord,"
10343,Much glory to receive.
10344,"That day, my honour I'll receive;"
10345,The Lord will dry my tears.
10346,"Today, while He must tarry still,"
10347,I'll press on faithfully.
10348,我若稍微偏離正路﹐
10349,我要立刻舒服﹔
10350,但我記念我主基督﹐
10351,如何忠心受苦。
10352,我今已經撇棄世界﹐
10353,所有關係都解﹔
10354,雖然道路越走越窄﹐
10355,但我在此是客。
10356,儘管別人藐視冷嘲﹐
10357,我只求主微笑﹔
10358,別人雖然喜歡外貌﹐
10359,但我要主的“好”。
10360,我心所望不是偉大﹐
10361,不是今生通達﹔
10362,我願現在卑微事主﹐
10363,那日得祂稱祝。
10364,我今每日舉目細望
10365,審判台前亮光﹔
10366,願我所有生活、工作﹐
10367,那日都能耐火。
10368,讓你們去得著名聲、
10369,富足、榮耀、友朋﹔
10370,讓你們去得著成功、
10371,讚美、從者、興隆。
10372,但我只願孤單、貧窮﹐
10373,在此不求亨通﹔
10374,我心切望忠誠跟從
10375,我主到了路終。
10376,因我知道﹐主在此世
10377,"不過得著一死,"
10378,所以現在我無他志﹐
10379,只願與祂損失。
10380,我的榮耀還在將來﹐
10381,今日只得忍耐﹔
10382,我決不肯先我的主
10383,在此得榮、得福。
10384,那日﹐我要得著尊貴﹐
10385,主要擦乾眼淚﹔
10386,今日﹐主既仍舊遲延﹐
10387,我要忠心進前。
10388,"His angels His countenance always behold,"
10389,"But never experience His grace,"
10390,"While saints on the earth know His love that enfolds,"
10391,Yet never have looked on His face.
10392,"They soon shall arise in His presence with awe,"
10393,The sight of His glory to gain.
10394,"But Mary, one day, in His tear-stained eyes saw"
10395,"His heartbreak of anguish and pain,"
10396,His heartbreak of anguish and pain.
10397,"We want to know Jesus, our Lord,"
10398,To know Him as never before.
10399,In heaven there's no need for a hand such as His
10400,To heal a heart broken and sore.
10401,"Above where we offer Him praise without end,"
10402,No praying with tears needed there;
10403,"Nor ever a burden to roll on our Friend,"
10404,"Or place for importunate prayer,"
10405,Or place for importunate prayer.
10406,"In heavenly glory we'll wear a bright crown,"
10407,And never more carry a cross.
10408,"It's only on earth where His life was disowned,"
10409,We share His rejection and loss.
10410,"Ent'ring into rest; in the morning so fair,"
10411,Our anguish and trials will end.
10412,"His sorrow and shame we no more with Him share,"
10413,"Or sacrifice pleasures for Him,"
10414,Or sacrifice pleasures for Him.
10415,"Alas, we're now left with few chances to share,"
10416,To learn and to taste of His grief.
10417,"Still yet for His sake, man's reproaches to bear,"
10418,Such time we may never retrieve.
10419,"These sorrows and pain, shall we still here bemoan,"
10420,When they will soon no longer be.
10421,"I treasure now Lord, all the pain I have known,"
10422,"For through it I'm made one with Thee,"
10423,For through it I'm made one with Thee.
10424,"I long, Lord, to look on Thy wonderful face,"
10425,'Twould surely be better by far.
10426,But rather I choose now Thy suffering grace
10427,Than have our sweet fellowship marred.
10428,"Have mercy, dear Lord, fill me full of Thy love,"
10429,My life shall be wholly for Thee.
10430,"Lest longing for joy in a heaven above,"
10431,"I fail here to suffer with Thee,"
10432,I fail here to suffer with Thee.
10433,祂的臉面﹐祂的天使常看見﹐
10434,但不認識祂的大愛﹔
10435,祂的聖徒雖然認識愛無限﹐
10436,卻未看見祂的丰采。
10437,他們不久也要看見祂臉面﹐
10438,認識祂的榮耀光明﹔
10439,但馬利亞曾看見祂的淚眼﹐
10440,知道祂心痛的情形﹐
10441,知道祂心痛的情形。
10442,我們快要完全知道我們主﹐
10443,已往從未如此知道﹔
10444,但是今日醫治傷心的摸撫﹐
10445,不是上面感覺得到。
10446,那日雖有無窮無盡的讚美﹐
10447,卻無流淚迫切禱告﹐
10448,卻無傷心痛苦所得的安慰﹐
10449,也無困難所生依靠﹐
10450,也無困難所生依靠。
10451,天上雖有無比榮耀的冠冕﹐
10452,但無十架可以順從﹔
10453,祂為我們所受一切的磨碾﹐
10454,在地才能與祂交通。
10455,進入安息﹐就再尋不到疲倦﹐
10456,再無機會為祂受苦﹐
10457,再也不能為祂經過何試煉﹐
10458,再為祂捨棄何幸福﹐
10459,再為祂捨棄何幸福。
10460,哎阿﹐為祂﹐機會已是何等少﹐
10461,所有機會快要過去﹐
10462,機會無多﹐為祂﹐蒙羞和受嘲﹐
10463,為祂﹐再來分心、分慮。
10464,不久就無誤會、怒罵與凌辱﹐
10465,就無孤單、寂寞、離別﹔
10466,我當寶貝這些不久的祝福﹐
10467,我藉這些與祢聯結﹐
10468,我藉這些與祢聯結。
10469,主﹐我羨慕早日看見祢臉面﹐
10470,那是實在好得無比﹔
10471,但是﹐我也不願免去祢試煉﹐
10472,失去如此交通甜蜜。
10473,求祢憐憫﹐使我充滿祢大愛﹐
10474,不顧一切為祢生活﹔
10475,免祢僕人今天急切望將來﹐
10476,將來又悔今天錯過﹐
10477,將來又悔今天錯過。
10478,My stubborn will at last hath yielded;
10479,"I would be Thine, and Thine alone;"
10480,"And this the prayer my lips are bringing,"
10481,"“Lord, let in me Thy will be done.”"
10482,"Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,"
10483,Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
10484,Till I am wholly lost in Thee.
10485,"I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary,"
10486,"The darksome path hath dreary grown,"
10487,But now a light has ris'n to cheer me;
10488,"I find in Thee my Star, my Sun."
10489,"Thy precious will, O conqu'ring Saviour,"
10490,Doth now embrace and compass me;
10491,"All discords hushed, my peace a river,"
10492,My soul a prisoned bird set free.
10493,"Shut in with Thee, O Lord, forever,"
10494,My wayward feet no more to roam;
10495,What pow'r from Thee my soul can sever?
10496,The center of God's will my home.
10497,頑梗我心已終於屈服，
10498,今願屬主，惟願屬主！
10499,我心禱告，我口今求呼：
10500,“願主旨意於我無阻！”
10501,願神美旨緊緊環抱我，
10502,使我全然消失於祢。
10503,久困罪行，厭倦而思歸，
10504,幽暗世路，煩悶淒涼；
10505,忽見一光，射入我心內，
10506,“哦，祢是我晨星、朝陽！”
10507,得勝的主，祢寶貝旨意
10508,繞我懷我直到永久；
10509,紛亂消失，平安何滿溢，
10510,又如困鳥釋放自由。
10511,禁閉於祢，與祢永相依，
10512,流蕩腳蹤不再游移；
10513,無何能使我與祢相離，
10514,我要永住祢美旨裏。
10647,"King of my life, I crown Thee now;"
10648,Thine shall the glory be.
10649,"Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,"
10650,Lead me to Calvary.
10651,"Lest I forget Gethsemane,"
10652,"Lest I forget Thine agony,"
10653,"Lest I forget Thy love for me,"
10654,"Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,"
10655,Tenderly mourned and wept;
10656,Angels in robes of light arrayed
10657,Guarded Thee while Thou slept.
10658,"Let me like Mary, through the gloom,"
10659,Come with a gift to Thee;
10660,"Show to me now the empty tomb,"
10661,"May I be willing, Lord, to bear"
10662,"Daily my cross for Thee,"
10663,Even Thy cup of grief to share;
10664,Thou hast borne all for me.
10665,"Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire"
10666,For all that know not Thee;
10667,Then touch my lips with holy fire
10668,To speak of Calvary.
10669,我今俯伏﹐生命的王﹐
10670,奉獻榮耀於祢﹔
10671,惟恐我忘祢的受創﹐
10672,領我去髑髏地。
10673,惟恐我忘客西馬尼﹐
10674,惟恐我忘祢心憂急﹐
10675,惟恐我忘祢愛無極﹐
10676,何處是祢被埋墳墓﹖
10677,讓我前去哀悼﹔
10678,天使是在何處守護﹖
10679,當祢息勞睡倒。
10680,讓我效法馬利亞女﹐
10681,前來向祢獻禮﹔
10682,請示空墓是在何許﹐
10683,使我甘心天天為祢
10684,背起我十字架﹔
10685,嘗祢苦杯﹐我也願意﹐
10686,因祢為我被殺。
10687,祢願得著所有的人﹐
10688,我求同此心意﹔
10689,求用聖火潔我嘴唇﹐
10690,來說祢髑髏地。
10691,Olives that have known no pressure
10692,Never can oil bestow;
10693,"If the grapes escape the winepress,"
10694,Cheering wine can never flow;
10695,"Spikenard only thro' the crushing,"
10696,Its fragrance can diffuse.
10697,Shall I then shrink from the suff'ring
10698,That Thy love would so induce?
10699,Each blow I suffer is true gain to me.
10700,"In the place of what Thou takest,"
10701,Thou dost give Thyself to me.
10702,"Do my heartstrings need Thy stretching,"
10703,Music divine to prove?
10704,Must the sweetest music come from
10705,The harsh treatment of Thy love?
10706,"Lord, I fear no deprivation"
10707,If I be drawn to Thee;
10708,I would yield in full surrender
10709,All Thy heart of love to see.
10710,"I'm ashamed, my Lord, for seeking"
10711,Myself to guard alway.
10712,"Though Thy love had done its stripping,"
10713,Yet I felt compelled Thy way.
10714,"Lord, according to Thy pleasure"
10715,Complete Thy work in me;
10716,"Heeding not my human feelings,"
10717,Only do what pleases Thee.
10718,"If Thy mind and mine should differ,"
10719,"Pursue, O Lord, Thy way;"
10720,"If Thy pleasure means my sorrow,"
10721,"Still my heart shall answer, ""Yea."""
10722,"'Tis my deep desire to please Thee,"
10723,"Though I might suffer loss,"
10724,E'en though Thy delight and glory
10725,Mean that I endure the cross.
10726,"Oh, I'll praise Thee, e'en if weeping"
10727,Be mingled with my song.
10728,Thine increasing sweetness calls forth
10729,Grateful praises all day long.
10730,Thou hast made Thyself more precious
10731,Than everything to me.
10732,"Thou increase and I decrease, Lord —"
10733,This is now my only plea.
10734,祢若不壓橄欖成渣﹐
10735,它就不能成油﹔
10736,祢若不投葡萄入醡﹐
10737,它就不能變成酒﹔
10738,祢若不煉哪噠成膏﹐
10739,它就不流芬芳﹔
10740,主﹐我這人是否也要
10741,受祢許可的創傷﹖
10742,每次的打擊﹐都是真利益﹔
10743,如果祢收去的東西﹐
10744,祢以自己來代替。
10745,祢是否要鼓我心絃﹐
10746,發出祢的音樂﹖
10747,是否要使音樂甘甜﹐
10748,須有祢愛來苦虐﹖
10749,是否當我下倒之時﹐
10750,纔能識“愛”的心﹖
10751,我是不怕任何損失﹐
10752,若祢讓我來相親。
10753,主﹐我慚愧﹐因我感覺
10754,總是保留自己﹔
10755,雖我也曾受祢雕削﹐
10756,我卻感覺受強逼。
10757,主﹐祢能否照祢喜樂﹐
10758,沒有顧忌去行﹐
10759,不顧我的感覺如何﹐
10760,只是要求祢歡欣﹖
10761,如果祢我所有苦樂
10762,不能完全相同﹐
10763,要祢喜樂﹐須我負軛﹐
10764,我就願意多苦痛。
10765,主﹐我全心求祢喜悅﹐
10766,不惜任何代價﹔
10767,祢若喜悅﹐並得榮耀﹐
10768,我背任何十字架。
10769,我要讚美﹐再要讚美﹐
10770,讚美何等甘甜﹔
10771,雖我邊讚美邊流淚﹐
10772,甘甜比前更加添。
10773,能有甚麼比祢更好﹖
10774,比祢喜悅可寶﹖
10775,主﹐我只有一個禱告﹕
10776,祢能加增﹐我減少。
10777,"Via Bethlehem we journey,"
10778,"We whose hearts on God are set,"
10779,"Babe-like souls of Jesus learning,"
10780,While our cheeks with tears are wet.
10781,For the manger and the stable
10782,"Are not pleasant to our eyes,"
10783,But our feet must follow Jesus
10784,If our hands would grasp the prize.
10785,Via Nazareth! the pathway
10786,"Narrows still as on we go,"
10787,Years of toil none understanding;
10788,Yet God teaches us to know
10789,That the servant is not greater
10790,"Than the Lord, who thro' long years"
10791,Hid Himself from this world's glory.
10792,Follow Him; count not the tears.
10793,Via Galilee we see Him!
10794,"Stones are hurled, and curses hissed"
10795,"By the men who gather round Him,"
10796,Has He not the pathway missed?
10797,"No! unharmed the Saviour passes,"
10798,And this rough bit of the way
10799,"We must travel, since like Jesus,"
10800,Nothing can our purpose stay.
10801,Via too the awful anguish
10802,Of the hours beneath the trees
10803,Where the hosts of Satan linger —
10804,Awful hours of anguish these!
10805,"Yet we fail not, for God's angels"
10806,"Minister to us and say,"
10807,"""Look, beloved, at the glory;"
10808,"Conflict is but for a day!"""
10809,Then the cross! for via Calvary
10810,Every royal soul must go;
10811,"Here we draw the veil, for Jesus"
10812,Only can the pathway show.
10813,"""If we suffer with Him,"" listen,"
10814,"Just a little, little while"
10815,And the mem'ry will have faded
10816,In the glory of His smile!
10817,"Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,"
10818,Knowing that all life has fled;
10819,"(Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered"
10820,With the men the world calls dead?)
10821,"Thence we rise and live with Jesus,"
10822,"Throned above the world's mad strife,"
10823,Gladly forfeiting forever
10824,All that worldlings count as life.
10825,"On we press! and yonder gleaming,"
10826,"Nearing every day, we see"
10827,The great walls of that fair city
10828,God has built for such as we;
10829,And we catch the tender music
10830,Of the choirs that sing of One
10831,Who once died to have us with Him
10832,"In His kingdom, on the throne."
10833,"Just a few more miles, beloved!"
10834,And our feet shall ache no more;
10835,"No more sin and no more sorrow,"
10836,"Hush thee, Jesus went before;"
10837,"And I hear Him sweetly whisp'ring,"
10838,"""Faint not, fear not, still press on,"
10839,"For it may be ere tomorrow,"
10840,"The long Journey will be done."""
10841,從伯利恆我們動身﹐
10842,學習耶穌的忠貞﹔
10843,跟著祂要完全歸神﹐
10844,但是臉上滿淚痕。
10845,因為馬槽那樣寒陋﹐
10846,並非我們所愛視﹔
10847,但是腳須與祂同走﹐
10848,如果手要接賞賜。
10849,經拿撒勒﹐這條道路﹐
10850,我們越走越窄小﹐
10851,多年勞碌無人領悟﹐
10852,常受羞辱﹐常無聊。
10853,但神藉此教訓我們﹕
10854,如此苦難﹐是因為
10855,僕人不能大於主人﹐
10856,所以當同祂流淚。
10857,經加利利﹐我們見祂
10858,被人厭棄﹐被人詛﹔
10859,祂路豈非走錯了嗎﹖
10860,不然那有許多苦﹖
10861,不！不！這段雖然崎嶇﹐
10862,祂仍前進平安過﹔
10863,我們若要同祂高舉﹐
10864,也得前進不畏禍。
10865,隨後就在客西馬尼﹐
10866,園中孤單受磨煉﹔
10867,撒但全軍都來攻逼﹐
10868,這樣光景真難遣！
10869,但是我們並不失敗﹐
10870,因有天使來服事﹐
10871,並說﹕“應當注目賞賚﹐
10872,爭戰不過此一時。”
10873,十架到了！因為所有
10874,忠魂都當經加略﹔
10875,我們在此同祂蒙羞﹐
10876,不肯自憐﹐不退卻。
10877,因為不過一點時候﹐
10878,我們如此感苦痛﹔
10879,將來見祂﹐一切憂愁
10880,要消在祂笑容中。
10881,隨到墳墓﹐親友環泣﹐
10882,知道已經無希望﹔
10883,(親愛旅伴！世人對你﹐
10884,是否算為已經亡﹖)
10885,我們從此與祂同升﹐
10886,遠離屬地的追求﹐
10887,心裏歡然失去世人﹐
10888,所謂生命和富有。
10889,我們努力向竿而前﹐
10890,日近一日仍追隨﹔
10891,我們已經彷彿能見
10892,天城四射的光輝﹔
10893,我們已經隱約可聞
10894,天樂悠揚的清音﹔
10895,耶穌在彼迎接我們﹐
10896,要慰百創的這心。
10897,不過﹐再過幾里﹐朋友！
10898,腿要不酸﹐身不累﹔
10899,不再有罪﹐不再有憂﹐
10900,主要擦乾你眼淚。
10901,聽祂正用柔聲說道﹕
10902,“勿恐﹐勿餒﹐仍力前﹐
10903,因為也許明朝未到﹐
10904,旅程就已到終點。”
10910,"Though Christ a thousand times in Bethlehem be born,"
10911,If He's not born in thee Thy soul is still forlorn.
10912,The Cross on Golgotha will never save thy soul;
10913,The Cross in thine own heart alone can make thee whole.
10914,"O, cross of Christ, I take thee into this heart of mine"
10915,"To help me die to my own self, and rise to Thy life divine."
10916,"Whate'er thou lovest, man, that too become thou must:"
10917,"God, if thou lovest God, dust, if thou lovest dust."
10918,"Go out, God will come in; die thou and let Him live;"
10919,Be not and He will be; wait and He'll all things give.
10920,"To bring thee to thy God, love takes the shortest route;"
10921,"The way which knowledge leads, is but a roundabout."
10922,"Drive out from thee the world, and then thy heart shall be"
10923,"Filled with the love of God, and holy like as He."
10924,基督雖能千趟降生於伯利恆﹐
10925,若未活你心坎﹐救恩仍是無成。
10926,各各他的十架﹐還不會拯救你﹔
10927,在你裏的十架﹐纔有能醫治你。
10928,哦！基督的十字架﹐我接祢進我心﹔
10929,使我脫自己管轄﹐完全靠父神生命。
10930,人哪！你愛何物﹐就要像你所慕﹔
10931,如主﹐你若愛主﹐如土﹐你若愛土。
10932,出己﹐神就進入﹐死己﹐神就活出﹔
10933,無你﹐就有基督﹐無物﹐就得萬物。
10934,你若要認識神﹐“愛”是最短路徑﹔
10935,你若跟從智慧﹐就難免常迂迴。
10936,你若不為自己尋求甚麼利益﹐
10937,神的聖潔愛心就要充滿你靈。
11003,"Oh, to be nothing, nothing!"
11004,"Only to lie at His feet,"
11005,A broken and emptied vessel
11006,For the Master's use made meet!
11007,Emptied that He might fill me
11008,As forth to His service I go;
11009,Broken that so unhinder'd
11010,His life through me might flow.
11011,"Oh to be nothing, nothing!"
11012,Only as led by His hand;
11013,"A messenger at His gateway,"
11014,Only waiting for His command.
11015,Only an instrument ready
11016,His praises to sound at His will;
11017,"Willing, should He not require me,"
11018,In silence to wait on Him still.
11019,"Painful the humbling may be,"
11020,Yet low in the dust I'd lay me
11021,That the world might my Saviour see.
11022,"Rather be nothing, nothing!"
11023,To Him let our voices be raised;
11024,"He is the Fountain of blessing,"
11025,He only is meet to be praised.
11026,哦﹐我願成為無有﹐
11027,惟在祂腳前守候﹔
11028,願我器皿破碎倒空﹐
11029,好適合我主來使用。
11030,倒空﹐使祂充滿我衷﹐
11031,使我出去作祂聖工﹔
11032,破碎﹐使祂不受攔阻﹐
11033,使祂生命從我流出。
11034,惟讓祂聖手導誘﹔
11035,作祂信使侍立門口﹐
11036,祂的吩咐我來聽候。
11037,作祂樂器隨時預備﹐
11038,照祂喜歡向祂讚美﹔
11039,祂若無需﹐我也願意
11040,在祂面前安靜侍立。
11041,降卑或許會苦憂﹔
11042,但我願意臥於塵土﹐
11043,好讓世人見我救主。
11044,甘願成為無有！無有！
11045,好讓世人讚祂不休﹕
11046,“祂是一切祝福源頭﹐
11047,讚美之聲﹐惟祂配受。”

11452,"Many times I fall and rise, Oft resolve and often fail;"
11453,"Craving vict'ry, I retreat, And my sad defeat bewail."
11454,Truly I am sold to sin and completely powerless;
11455,"There's no good within my flesh, All is dark and sinfulness."
11456,"Now I know myself in part, And confess my helplessness;"
11457,"All my temperament is odd, All my life corrupted is."
11458,"Subtle self I cannot trust, Nor to fleshly strength can cling;"
11459,All my trust and all my hope is in Jesus Christ my King.
11460,May the Cross put me to death that on Christ I may rely;
11461,"May His Holy Spirit fill, That Himself I may apply."
11462,"May His death so work in me daily deeper than before,"
11463,"That my self may be destroyed, And His life thru me may pour."

11467,I receive Him as my life and my portion measureless.
11468,"Now I'm wholly sanctified, Selfless, I obey His word;"
11469,Nevermore to feel ashamed when I come before the Lord.
11470,How transcendent is this life! Grace thru faith He gives to me!
11471,"Praise the Lord, He heard my cry and has made me wholly free."
11472,求主啟示主自己，使我認識我肉體；
11473,願主亮光大作工，使我俯伏灰塵中。
11474,追憶我已久求勝，直到今日仍無能！
11475,善雖願意作不來，惡雖恨惡脫不開。
11476,裏面意思雖要神，一行出來總可恨；
11477,愛莫能助將奈何！事與願違真束縛！
11478,神律纔顯罪便在，善念一動惡也來；
11479,肢體的律擄了我，掙扎奮鬥終難脫。
11480,多次跌倒，多次起，時而立志，時而遺，
11481,要求得勝反退潰，願意成聖倒污穢。
11482,我實已是賣給罪，我真已經無能為，
11483,我的肉體沒良善，我的自己乃黑暗。
11484,我今已略識自己，實在沒有一點力，
11485,我的性情真古怪，我的生命全敗壞，
11486,我心詭詐不可靠，我人軟弱不能保，
11487,我今所有的盼望，都在耶穌我的王。
11488,求主十架治死我，使我靠主而生活；
11489,求主聖靈充滿我，使我憑主而工作。
11490,願主的死在我身，天天作工比前深；
11491,讓我自己全消滅，讓主生命來提挈。
11492,我的光景真是苦，誰能使我不為奴-
11493,救我脫離取死身，使我能夠常得勝？
11494,耶穌為我流寶血，基督作我的聖潔；
11495,我今接祂為生命，我今服祂的號令。
11496,完全聖潔無惡意！完全順服無自己-
11497,不再覺羞到父前！不再難過見主面！
11498,哦，這生命何等高！一信，主恩即臨到！
11499,感謝主今聽呼求，使我完全得自由。
11580,"My will is weak, my strength is frail,"
11581,And all my hope is nearly gone;
11582,I can but trust Thy working true
11583,To gently hold and lead me on.
11584,"I've tried my best, but still have failed,"
11585,E'en as before I've failed and erred;
11586,"Thy patience is my only trust,"
11587,To hold and keep me to Thy word.
11588,"Whene'er my heart is lifted up,"
11589,How very near I am to fall;
11590,"I dare not do, I dare not think,"
11591,I need Thyself in great or small.
11592,"Thou art my Saviour, strength and stay,"
11593,"O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;"
11594,"Though I'm the weakest of the weak,"
11595,My strength is nothing but Thy grace.
11596,意志薄弱，能力軟弱，
11597,盼望已經全都消滅﹔
11598,只有信託祢的工作，
11599,將我這人溫柔提挈。
11600,盡我所有，所有失敗，
11601,失敗至今，失敗頻頻﹔
11602,無何可信，信祢能耐，
11603,能夠促我聽祢聲音。
11604,當我的心稍微高仰，
11605,我就近乎跌倒危地；
11606,我不敢作，我不敢想，
11607,事事處處，我需要祢。
11608,祢是救主…剛強…體貼，
11609,哦，主，我今尋求祢面；
11610,雖然我是弱中弱者，
11611,我的能力惟祢恩典。
11612,嘴唇不潔，心思不潔，
11613,都是失敗，都是污穢；
11614,前所盼望，今已消滅，
11615,主，祢是否仍有恩惠？
11616,聖潔裏面，仍有行為，
11617,謙卑時候，仍憑自己；
11618,連我流淚為罪懊悔，
11619,都需祢血把它潔淨。
11620,最好存心，仍存自己，
11621,最大捨己，仍有動機；
11622,我心就是我的仇敵，
11623,主，我希望可否在祢？
11624,事奉神中，有己意思，
11625,愛別人中，有己興趣；
11626,我不能動，我不敢止，
11627,事事處處有己寄寓。
11628,我的所有，無一純潔，
11629,只要一動，就有自己；
11630,何等羨慕祢的榮耀，
11631,完全充滿蒙福心地。
11632,不敢祈求，不敢應許，
11633,主，我只能向祢注視；
11634,可否差遣祢的話語，
11635,將祢榮耀向我啟示？
11720,"Come empty me of self, O Lord, my cunning heart renew."
11721,"So wondrous holy is this work, no one but Thou can do."
11722,"Come empty me of self, O Lord, no good there is inside."
11723,"Deceived by pride, thro' out my life, in darkness do I hide."
11724,"Come empty me of self, so I can at last be revived."
11725,"Hear Thou my cry to Thee, O Lord, cleanse Thou these sins of mine!"
11726,"I cannot bear to see myself, more so those eyes of Thine."
11727,Why do I live in restlessness? Show me what to discard!
11728,My conscience keeps accusing me — what sin do I regard?
11729,"In fellowship with Thee, Thy face is oft' hidden and veiled;"
11730,Why is my faith so insecure? Show me where I have failed!
11731,求主倒空我脫自己，我心滿詭詐；
11732,這個重大聖潔成績，只祢有辦法。
11733,求主倒空我脫自己，裏面無良善；
11734,我的一生全是受欺，驕傲因黑暗；
11735,求主倒空我脫自己，裏面真黑暗。
11736,求祢聽我向祢呼祈，罪過何難除！
11737,自己越看越不滿意，何況祢聖目？
11738,我的不安是為甚麼，求祢來揭露；
11739,良心時常控告不默，我注重何垢？
11740,祢我之間有重幔子，交通常間斷；
11741,到底是在那裏有失，信心不坦然？
11742,"I am crucified with Jesus,"
11743,And the cross hath set me free;
11744,"I have ris'n again with Jesus,"
11745,And He lives and reigns in me.
11746,"Oh! It is so sweet to die with Jesus,"
11747,"To the world, and self, and sin;"
11748,Oh! It is so sweet to live with Jesus
11749,As He lives and reigns within.
11750,Myst'ry hid from ancient ages;
11751,But at length to faith made plain;
11752,"Christ in me the Hope of Glory,"
11753,Tell it o'er and o'er again.
11754,"This the secret, nature hideth,"
11755,"Summer dies and lives again,"
11756,"Spring from winter's grave ariseth,"
11757,Harvest grows from buried grain.
11758,"This the secret of the holy,"
11759,"Not our holiness, but Him;"
11760,Jesus! Empty us and fill us
11761,With Thy fullness to the brim.
11762,"This the balm for pain and sickness,"
11763,"Just to all our strength to die,"
11764,"And to find His life and fullness,"
11765,All our beings' need supply.
11766,"This the story of the Master,"
11767,"Through the Cross, He reached the throne,"
11768,"And like Him our path to glory,"
11769,Ever leads through death alone.
11770,我與基督已同釘死，
11771,十架已將我解釋；
11772,我與基督已同復活，
11773,祂生我裏管理我。
11774,與基督同死，何等的安適！
11775,脫世界、自己、罪惡；
11776,與基督同活，何等的超脫！
11777,歷世歷代所藏奧祕，
11778,今藉信心可知悉：
11779,榮耀盼望-基督居衷，
11780,應當無時不歌頌。
11781,天然景物都有隱徵：
11782,麥種死了子粒生；
11783,珍木接在賤樹上面，
11784,小則換大，苦換甜。
11785,這個就是聖潔祕訣-
11786,不是自己無殘缺；
11787,主阿，求祢虛我、滿我，
11788,擴我度量給我多。
11789,這個會使病痛得治-
11790,只要你向自己死；
11791,並以主的生命能力，
11792,作為全人的供給。
11793,經過十架，達到寶座，
11794,主是這樣的領率；
11795,先是死亡，後是榮耀，
11796,主既如此我倣效。
11797,"Lord, Thou hast shown the mystery,"
11798,How on the Cross I died with Thee;
11799,I need no other pow'r or way
11800,That I may triumph day by day.
11801,"That cross of Thine is also mine,"
11802,Into my life its light doth shine;
11803,"When I believe I'm dead with Thee,"
11804,The world has lost its pow'r o'er me.
11805,"Since I am crucified with Thee,"
11806,From sin and self I am set free;
11807,How can I still enjoy the world
11808,Or seek its vanities unfurled?
11809,"I take my place, dear Lord, with Thee"
11810,Upon the cross of Calvary.
11811,"Thy life and power then are mine,"
11812,Since Thou and I in oneness twine.
11813,"Since Thou didst come to slay the foe,"
11814,"His work and power to overthrow,"
11815,I too can overcome in Thee
11816,And prove Thy mighty pow'r in me.
11817,"Yet, for the vict'ry we rely"
11818,Upon the death which Thou didst die;
11819,We tread the path which Thou hast trod
11820,Until we reach the goal in God.
11821,My death with Thee I now believe
11822,And all its meaning would receive.
11823,"Thy death more deeply show to me,"
11824,That from my flesh I may be free.
11825,"I long to win as Thou hast won,"
11826,To reign with Thee when Thou dost come.
11827,"If we the cross will gladly bear,"
11828,Then in Thy glory we will share.
11829,主，祢啟示一個奧祕，
11830,就是我同祢死的理；
11831,不用別法，不用別能，
11832,我就看見完全得勝。
11833,祢的十架就是我的，
11834,其光照耀我生命裏；
11835,一信與祢同釘那裏，
11836,世界失去它的能力。
11837,我既與祢十架同釘，
11838,勝過罪惡、自己、人情；
11839,我怎追求它們事物？
11840,我怎盼望它們安福？
11841,因此，我便到祢那裏，
11842,與祢同站十架死地，
11843,祢命、祢權，全是我的，
11844,因我與祢合而為一。
11845,祢既是來敗壞魔鬼
11846,一切權力、捆綁、作為，
11847,我自然可和祢同勝，
11848,天天經歷祢的大能。
11849,但是我主，我們只能
11850,靠著祢的十架得勝；
11851,祢走的路，我們當走，
11852,直到與祢見面時候。
11853,我今接受祢的同釘，
11854,求祢所賜永遠的靈；
11855,使我明白祢死更深，
11856,使我喪失魂的生命。
11857,我願得勝像祢得勝！
11858,與祢同王，同得權能！
11859,背負十架，我們若肯，
11860,這些榮耀必定有分！
11861,"Lord, Thou knowest all the hunger of the heart that seeks Thee now;"
11862,How my soul hath long been craving what Thou only canst bestow.
11863,"Seeking now, seeking now. Let Thy Spirit meet me now."
11864,"Failure in my walk and witness, failure in my work I see;"
11865,"Fruitless toil, un-Christ like living, calling forth no praise to Thee."
11866,"Now to Thee my soul confesses all its failure, all its sin;"
11867,"All the pride, the self-contentment, all the ""secret faults"" within."
11868,"Save me from myself, my father, from each subtle form of pride;"
11869,"Lead me now with Christ to Calv'ry, show me I with Him have died."
11870,"No more let it be my working, Nor my wisdom, love, or pow'r,"
11871,"But the life of Jesus only, passing through me hour by hour."
11872,"Let the fullness of Thy Spirit, resting on Him cover me,"
11873,"That the witness borne to others, may bring glory, Lord, to Thee."
11874,"Father, in Thy Son's Name, pleading, I believe my prayer is heard;"
11875,"And I praise Thee for the answer, resting simply on Thy word."
11876,"Praising now, praising now, thou hast answered, Lord, I know!"
11877,主，祢知道所有乾渴，在這不足尋求心；
11878,我心羨慕何等深刻，惟祢能使不饑饉。
11879,今尋求，今尋求，賜祢聖靈的富有。
11880,行為失敗，見證失敗，工作失敗已明顯；
11881,無果之勞，非主之態，對祢沒有讚美獻。
11882,我今向祢承認我的所有失敗和邪惡，
11883,所有自滿，所有剛愎，所有心裏的隱慝。
11884,父阿，救我脫離自己，脫離化裝的驕傲；
11885,帶我與主同到死地，知道同釘的奇道。
11886,從今不再是我工作，我想、我愛或我說；
11887,惟獨乃是基督生活，時時刻刻通過我。
11888,但願祢的滿有聖靈，流通在我的衷表；
11889,好叫對人，我是證明，對祢，乃是歸榮耀。
11890,父阿，我奉子名禱告，我信禱告已答應；
11891,我今讚美，答應可靠，安息，只因話足憑。
11892,就讚美，就讚美，因祢已聽我禱告。
11893,哦，各各他！好，各各他！我主在此受死；
11894,祂流寶血，祂釘苦架，使我從罪得釋。
11895,因此，切求我主，啟示各各他的奧祕；
11896,使我知道現在我是與祂合而為一。
11897,哦，各各他！好，各各他！在此我同主死；
11898,藉著與主同釘十架，我的重負得釋。
11899,哦，各各他！主的空墳也曾把我埋過；
11900,主的復甦我也有分，因此我能生活。
11901,哦，各各他！撒但全軍在此被主羞辱；
11902,奉著主名，邪靈、魔君，向我也當俯伏。
11903,哦，各各他！我有主名，在爭戰時已足；
11904,仇敵一聽，立即亡命，不能抵擋我主。
11905,哦，各各他！我讚美主！因祂在此受死；
11906,捨了祂命，贖我罪辜，使我捆綁全釋。
11907,哦，各各他！我願學習祢的所有意義！
11908,我今因信，在得勝地，與主一同站立。

11921,"祢是""平靜""祕密之源，祢是神聖全足的愛；"
11922,我們靠祢，所以安全，我的幫助，我的山寨；
11923,耶穌，我們是藉祢名，能脫犯罪、憂愁、震驚。
11924,祢名乃是我們救恩，賞賜喜樂入我心懷；
11925,祢名帶來平安、興奮、能力，並加永遠的愛；
11926,祢名已經賜給我們赦免、聖潔，並加天門。
11927,耶穌，祢是我們一切：痛時，安舒；苦時，安息；
11928,傷心之時，祢是音樂；亂時，平安；失時，利益；
11929,怒目冷眼，祢是笑臉；羞辱，祢是榮耀冠冕。
11930,缺乏，祢是我們富有；軟弱，祢是我們能力；
11931,束縛，祢是完全自由；試探，祢是可靠逃避；
11932,失望、憂愁，祢是喜悅；死亡，生命；我主，一切。

12055,He sends the harvest's golden grain —
12056,"Sunshine and rain, and golden grain, He is my Friend."
12057,"Jesus is all the world to me, and true to Him I'll be;"
12058,"Oh, how could I this Friend deny when He's so true to me?"
12059,"Following Him I know I'm right,"
12060,Keeping His cross within my sight;
12061,Following Him by day and night; He is my Friend!
12062,Jesus is all the world to me — I want no better Friend;
12063,"I trust Him now, I'll trust Him when life's fleeting days shall end."
12064,Beautiful life with such a Friend!
12065,Beautiful life that has no end!
12066,"Eternal life, eternal joy; He is my Friend."
12067,基督就是我的世界﹐生命、喜樂、一切﹔
12068,祂是能力﹐時時提挈﹐離祂我就傾跌。
12069,當我憂愁﹐我來就祂﹐
12070,無人如此樂於接納﹔
12071,使我心樂﹐消我心憂﹐祂是我友﹗
12072,基督就是我的世界﹐百般試煉之助﹔
12073,處處照顧﹐事事體貼﹐一再向我賜福。
12074,祂賜水流﹐又賜日光﹐
12075,祂賜豐收﹐金穀興旺﹔
12076,日光水流﹐金穀豐收﹐祂是我友﹗
12077,基督就是我的世界﹐對祂我必效忠﹗
12078,我怎能夠將祂棄絕﹐當祂施恩重重﹖
12079,隨祂行走﹐必不會錯﹐
12080,有祂引領﹐晝夜無輟﹔
12081,隨祂行走﹐夜以繼晝﹐祂是我友﹗
12082,基督就是我的世界﹐更好朋友無需﹔
12083,現今聯結﹐將來聯結﹐直到永久不渝。

12087,"He faileth not, for He is God;"
12088,"He faileth not, His grace how good!"
12089,"He faileth not, His word is clear;"
12090,"If we have God, whom need we fear?"
12091,"The highest mount, He can make plain;"
12092,"The wildest flood, He can restrain."
12093,God of impossibilities!
12094,"Poor puny man, now learn His ways."
12095,The axe did swim on Jordan's wave;
12096,Our God the Red Sea's waters clave!
12097,"He stopped the sun, made long the day!"
12098,This is the God to Whom we pray.
12099,He bars the sea with feeble sand!
12100,The proud waves bow at His command!
12101,"If God is thine, what more your need?"
12102,Can He not work for you indeed?
12103,"Our God is love, your needs are known,"
12104,"His promises He'll fully own,"
12105,Our gracious God bows down His ear
12106,"The feeblest, weakest cry to hear."
12107,"Our God is light, and never yet,"
12108,One promise did He e'er forget;
12109,His promises in Christ the Son
12110,"Are fully pledged, yea and amen."
12111,"Our faithful God, faith cannot break;"
12112,"Nor death, nor hell, His promise shake!"
12113,"Who ask in faith, He'll not deny;"
12114,"His word is sure, He must reply."
12115,"He faileth not, let all men hear,"
12116,"He faileth not, His word is clear,"
12117,"He faileth not, His grace how good,"
12118,"He faileth not, for He is God."
12119,祂不誤事﹐因祂是神﹔
12120,祂不誤事﹐祂樂施恩﹔
12121,祂不誤事﹐祂已許過﹔
12122,我們有神﹐還怕誰何﹖
12123,有何高山祢不能鋤﹐
12124,有何深水祢不能渡﹔
12125,我們的神專門處置
12126,人所以為不能的事。
12127,是祂使鐵浮水而起﹐
12128,是祂使海分成乾地﹐
12129,是祂使日半空停止﹐
12130,我們的神並無難事！
12131,祂使軟沙作海界限﹐
12132,波浪雖狂不能再前﹔
12133,祂是你神﹐還有甚麼
12134,祂是不能為你工作﹖
12135,祂心愛你﹐知你難處﹐
12136,所以應許祂要照顧﹔
12137,我們的神充滿憐憫﹐
12138,對待祂的無告子民。
12139,我們的神不能不義﹐
12140,不能將祂應許忘記﹔
12141,祂的應許在基督裏﹐
12142,都是阿們﹐都是是的。
12143,我們的神不能失信﹐
12144,祂的恩約永遠堅定﹔
12145,祂要照祂應許答應
12146,我們因信所發呼聲。
12147,我們因信歡樂唱說﹕
12148,祂不誤我﹐祂已許過！
12149,祂不誤我﹐祂樂施恩！
12150,祂不誤我﹐因祂是神！
12151,"Keep up the song of faith,"
12152,However dark the night;
12153,"And as you praise, the Lord will work"
12154,"To change your faith to sight,"
12155,To change your faith to sight.
12156,"And let your heart be strong,"
12157,"For God delights when faith can praise,"
12158,"Though dark the night and long,"
12159,Though dark the night and long.
12160,The foe will hear and flee;
12161,"Oh, let not Satan hush your song,"
12162,"For praise is victory,"
12163,For praise is victory.
12164,"The dawn will break ere long,"
12165,And we shall go to meet the Lord
12166,"And join the endless song,"
12167,And join the endless song.
12168,再唱信心的歌﹗
12169,無論夜如何黑﹔
12170,你若讚美﹐神要工作﹐
12171,使你所信能得﹐
12172,使你所信能得。
12173,再唱信心的歌！
12174,你魂應當讚頌﹔
12175,因神喜悅信心唱歌﹐
12176,於漫漫長夜中﹐
12177,於漫漫長夜中。
12178,仇敵聽見要抖﹔
12179,讚美原來會勝鬼魔﹐
12180,何致被他箝口﹐
12181,何致被他箝口。
12182,不久天就要曙﹔
12183,我們要唱無終的歌﹐
12184,我們要去見主﹐
12185,我們要去見主。
12186,"I know not why God's wondrous grace, to me hath been made known;"
12187,"Nor why unworthy as I am, He claimed me for His own."
12188,"But I know whom I have believed,"
12189,And am persuaded that He is able
12190,To keep that which I've committed unto Him against that day.
12191,I know not how this saving faith to me He did impart;
12192,Or how believing in His word wrought peace within my heart.
12193,"I know not how the Spirit moves, convincing men of sin;"
12194,"Revealing Jesus through the Word, creating faith in Him."
12195,I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for me —
12196,Of weary ways or golden days before His face I see.
12197,"I know not when my Lord may come, at night or noonday fair,"
12198,Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him or meet Him in the air.
12199,我真不知神的奇恩﹐為何臨到我身﹔
12200,我也不知不堪如我﹐救來有何足多。
12201,惟知道我所信的是誰﹐
12202,並且也深信祂實在是能
12203,保守我所信託祂的﹐都全備直到那日﹗
12204,我真不知救我的信如何進入我心﹐
12205,我也不知何以一信﹐便得一個新心。
12206,我真不知聖靈如何引人知道己過﹐
12207,並由聖經顯明耶穌﹐使人接祂為主。
12208,我真不知我的前途﹐到底是甘是苦﹔
12209,我也不知未見主前﹐還有甚麼試煉。
12210,我真不知何時主來﹐那時我是何在–
12211,到底我當經過死谷﹖或將空中遇主﹖
12246,"Standing on the faithfulness of God's own Word,"
12247,I shall praise His endless glory evermore.
12248,"For by faith thru heavy veils the highest heav'n I see,"
12249,From afar His loving face brings floods of joy to me.
12250,"Standing, standing on the faithfulness of God's own Word;"
12251,"Resting, resting on the promise of His pow'r and might."
12252,"Hallelujah, hallelujah! Here I find the heav'nly secret heights."
12253,I shall praise His endless power evermore.
12254,"Sprinkled by the blood, His word is living, sharp and firm."
12255,"Broken are my chains of doubt, O Glory to His name."
12256,I shall praise His endless mercy evermore.
12257,"By his blood and through His grace, drawn near His side I'd be."
12258,Cords of love do bind my heart to Him eternally!
12259,I shall praise His endless path for evermore.
12260,Ever watchful in Him till I'll cross the Jordan's tide;
12261,Gone my pain and foes when I shall reach my home sweet home.
12262,"站立在神話語的信實上面,"
12263,我要讚美祂的榮耀無窮盡!
12264,因信舉目透過重幔直達最高天;
12265,遙見救主慈愛面容，喜樂滿我心。
12266,站立，站立在神話語的信實上面；
12267,安息，安息在神應許的能力上面。
12268,哈利路亞，哈利路亞！這裏就是最高祕密天！
12269,站立在神話語的信實上面，
12270,我要讚美祂的能力無窮盡！
12271,血灑約言永不搖移，神話成利劍；
12272,砍斷一切不信鎖鍊，榮耀歸主名。
12273,我要讚美祂的慈愛無窮盡！
12274,靠主寶血我蒙恩寵，常近祂身邊；
12275,慈繩愛索深繫我心，與主永相連。
12276,我要讚美祂的道路無窮盡！
12277,時刻儆醒，緊隨聖靈，直到過約但；
12278,傷痛得醫，仇敵失蹤，抵家樂無盡。
12279,"'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take Him at His word;"
12280,"Just to rest upon His promise; just to know, ""Thus saith the Lord."""
12281,"Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!"
12282,How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!
12283,"Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust Him more!"
12284,"Oh how sweet to trust in Jesus, just to trust His cleansing blood;"
12285,"Just in simple faith to plunge me 'neath the healing, cleansing flood."
12286,"Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus, just from sin and self to cease;"
12287,"Just from Jesus simply taking life and rest, and joy and peace."
12288,"I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee, precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;"
12289,"And I know that Thou art with me, wilt be with me to the end."
12290,信靠耶穌何其甘甜﹐抓祂話語作把握﹔
12291,安息在祂應許上面﹐只知主曾如此說。
12292,耶穌﹐耶穌﹐何等可靠﹐
12293,我曾試祂多少次﹔
12294,耶穌﹐耶穌﹐我的至寶﹐祂是活神不誤事。
12295,信靠耶穌﹐何其甘甜﹐信祂寶血能潔淨﹔
12296,信心簡單﹐血有效驗﹐疾病醫治﹐罪洗清。
12297,信靠耶穌﹐真是甘甜﹐救我遠離罪與己﹔
12298,從祂接受無限恩典﹕生命、喜樂和安息。
12299,何等喜樂﹐我能信祢﹐至寶耶穌﹐我救主！
12300,信祢與我是在一起﹐一直一起到永古。
12309,In some way or other the Lord will provide:
12310,"It may not be my way, it may not be the way;"
12311,"And yet in His own way, ""the Lord will provide."""
12312,"Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;"

12318,And this be the token-no word He hath spoken

12323,或這樣，或那樣，主總必豫備：
12324,雖不照我方法，也不照你方法，
12325,主要照祂方法，為我們豫備。
12326,我安心靠主，因主必豫備；
12327,我完全望主，因主要豫備。
12328,或這時，或那時，主總必豫備：
12329,雖不照我時候，也不照你時候，
12330,在主所定時候，主總必豫備。
12331,所以不要懷疑，因主必豫備：
12332,我主所有應許，那裏曾有一句
12333,變作烏有空虛？主總必豫備。
12334,因此，應當進前，進前不疲憊；
12335,海水必定分開，嗎哪要從天來，
12336,仇敵都要失敗，主總必豫備。
12337,主阿，即或盡是黑暗，盡是坎坷憂悒；
12338,但我仍要鎮定安然，尋求袮的心意。
12339,袮有憐憫，袮有恩慈，袮有寶貴應許；
12340,袮不會錯，袮不會遲，袮不翻雲覆雨。
12341,大能的主，說有就有，命立沒有不立；
12342,有主就可無掛無憂，就可不焦不急。
12343,主阿，因袮我心定了，因袮我魂安歇；
12344,我讚美說：有主夠了！主是包括一切！
12345,主，我還要求袮的靈，使我信心充足；
12346,領我更深認識袮名，進入袮的豐富。
12384,"When sorrows and storms are besetting my track,"
12385,"And Satan is whisp'ring, ""You'd better go back,"""
12386,"Oh, then I have prov'd it tho' dark be the way,"
12387,A little believing drives clouds right away.
12388,"Lord, I believe! Lord, I believe!"
12389,"Saviour, raise my faith in Thee till it can move a mountain."
12390,All my doubts I'll bury in the Fountain.
12391,How easy when sailing the sea at a calm
12392,"To trust in the strength of Jehovah's great arm,"
12393,"But somehow I find when the waves swamp the boat,"
12394,It takes some believe to keep things afloat.
12395,"""I'll stand to the end,"" I have heard people say,"
12396,"""I'll fight till I die, and I'll ne'er run away;"""
12397,"But when the temptations so fiercely assailed,"
12398,"They left off believing, and terribly failed."
12399,"And others there are full of courage and zeal,"
12400,Who go to the battle like warriors of steel;
12401,"But right in the heat of the conflict with sin,"
12402,"Instead of believing, they faint and give in."
12403,"Oh, let us remember, in running our race,"
12404,"That faith is not feeling, and trust is not trace;"
12405,"And when all is seeming as black as the night,"
12406,"We'll keep on believing, and go on with the fight."
12407,當我在我路上遇見試探時，
12408,撒但就在耳語叫我可放弛；
12409,但是負擔雖重我已不發愁，
12410,只要一點相信就趕難處走。
12411,主，我相信！主，我相信！
12412,求提高我信袮的心，使我能以移山；
12413,我的疑慮全投在袮身畔。
12414,當我航行海上順風的時候，
12415,何等容易相信耶和華的手；
12416,但我發現正當波浪漫船來，
12417,需要好多相信纔能不沉埋。
12418,"我常聽人說，""我要堅持到底，"
12419,"我要忠心至死，我絕不逃避；"""
12420,但當試探來得特別兇猛時，
12421,他就停止相信，甚麼都喪失。
12422,還有別人滿有勇敢與熱心，
12423,他們參加事奉如同鋼鐵人；
12424,但是正當與罪摔跤最熱時，
12425,他們不是相信，乃是怕損失。
12426,但願我們記得，在屬靈生活，
12427,信心不是感覺，信靠非撫摸；
12428,正當一切好像最看不見時，
12429,我們仍要相信，因而仍堅持。
12430,Share thy handful with the stranger; bid the Prophet to thy board;

12434,"Keep on loving, keep on giving, still you'll find one handful more."

12436,"Trust! The Lord will not deny thee, ev'ry longing shall be stilled;"

12439,Even then the widow's barrel shall its handful still retain.
12440,Why shouldst thou forecast the morrow? Take with gladness while you may;
12441,"Why, dismayed, forbodings borrow? See! Thou hast enough today:"
12442,"'Tis by loving that thou livest, spending doth not waste thy store,"
12443,"Tho' it seems the last thou givest, there is, aye, one handful more."
12444,何必擔心一握不釋？且讓先知先果腹；
12445,若是神管你的度支，你的來源何患枯？
12446,每天都有新的需要，每天必有新供給；
12447,你既然是祂所創造，祂豈不為你設計？
12448,仍然當愛，仍然當給，照舊你還餘一握；
12449,所有的愛，所有的給，要使神賜加倍多。
12450,相信！時候不至蹉跎，雖是不快，總不慢；
12451,相信！瓶子不至乾涸，永遠不空，也不滿。
12452,縱使百合缺了衣衫，縱使小鳥無食啄，
12453,但是寡婦微小麵罈，必定依然有一握。
12454,何必豫料明天境遇，目前夠了就可樂；
12455,何必先借明天憂慮，手裏豈非還有著！
12456,愛是生活，給反存留，種得多的，收也多；
12457,好像你已罄你所有，看哪！你還有一握！
12458,"Only believe, only believe;"

12463,"Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,"
12464,"Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heav'n and home,"

12467,"His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me."
12468,"I sing because I'm happy, I sing because I'm free,"

12474,"When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,"
12475,"I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free:"
12476,為何灰心常怨歎？為何黑影瀰漫？
12477,為何心靈覺孤單，甚至欲脫塵寰？
12478,耶穌是我的永分，是我良友恩深。
12479,祂既看顧小麻雀，深知我必蒙眷佑；
12480,祂既看顧小麻雀，深知我必蒙眷佑。
12481,我唱，因我得自由，我唱，因我無憂；
12482,我救主既看顧麻雀，深知我必蒙眷佑。
12483,"""你心裏不要憂愁！""祂柔聲來勸誘；"
12484,在祂愛中我安息，不再懼怕、憂疑；
12485,雖我只見前一步，祂正引領無誤。
12486,每當試探來引誘，烏雲密佈四周；
12487,每當歎息勝歌唱，心中滿了絕望；
12488,我就向祂更靠近，讓祂解我憂心。
12489,"I know not what awaits me, God kindly veils my eyes,"
12490,"And o'er each step of my on — ward way, He makes new scenes to rise;"
12491,And ev'ry joy He sends me comes a sweet and glad surprise.
12492,"Where he may lead I'll follow, my trust in Him repose;"
12493,"And ev'ry hour in perfect peace, I'll sing, ""He knows! He knows!"""
12494,"One step I see before me, 'tis all I need to see,"
12495,The light of heaven more brightly shines when earth's illusions flee;
12496,"And sweetly through the silence comes, His loving, ""Trust in Me!"""
12497,"Oh, blissful lack of wisdom, 'tis blessed not to know;"
12498,"He holds me with His own right hand, and will not let me go,"
12499,And lulls my troubled soul to rest In Him who loves me so.
12500,So on I go not knowing; I would not if I might;
12501,I'd rather walk in the dark with God than go alone in the light;
12502,I'd rather walk by faith with Him than go alone by sight.
12503,前途如何我不知，神將我眼遮蔽；
12504,在我向前每步路上，都有新的境地；
12505,祂所賜的每一喜樂，也都令人驚奇。
12506,我願跟隨祂帶領，對祂完全信靠；
12507,"隨時隨在安然唱道：""祂知道，祂知道；"""
12508,眼前一步我看見，已夠應付需要；
12509,屬地幻想若肯去掉，天光就必照耀；

12511,"哦，那有福的""無智""，""不知""真是福氣！"
12512,祂用右手將我握住，不肯讓我稍離，
12513,並使我的受驚心魂，在祂愛中安息。
12514,如此不知而向前，能知，我也不願；
12515,寧願暗中與神同行，不願光中孤單；
12516,寧願憑信與神同行，不願憑著眼見。
12517,我與神聖的愛立約，這約豐富非我能悟；
12518,神聖信實作它根基，救主中保永遠穩固。
12519,哦，主，我接受袮自己，向袮我獻我的自己；
12520,我要照袮可靠應許，來領袮的一切豐富。
12521,我接受袮完全救恩，因主已經為我捨身；
12522,袮要作我負責牧人，引導我過一生路程。
12523,我接受袮應許聖靈，我接受袮非造生命；
12524,前來充滿微弱的心，使我一生充滿歡欣。
12525,我接受袮為這身體，驅我病痛沉坷克立起；
12526,能力流通，何等希奇，我來就袮天來良醫。
12527,我接受袮作我生命，改變大能不斷運行；
12528,每一斑點都被洗淨，模我、造我，成袮榮形。
12529,我照袮話來信袮名，我要讚美袮話可信；
12530,無數恩惠足以證明救主恩約永遠堅定。
12537,神的應許不能廢去，句句都是堅定；
12538,信心從來不用憑據，因神言出必行。
12539,天地雖能被焚燒，小山大山雖傾倒；
12540,但那相信主的人，必見主話得成。
12541,你心該像亞伯拉罕那樣舉目望天；
12542,數算眾星，輕看艱難，信心越久越堅。
12543,即使黑雲暫時濃厚，雲上太陽未變；
12544,只要再過一點時侯，陽光就要顯現。
12545,雖遇試煉仍要鎮定，因為在火窯中
12546,有榮耀的神子同行，仇敵終要擊空。
12547,縱然朋友都辜負你，但你還當信神；
12548,因為耶穌-袮的能力，仍然親近施恩。
12549,凡事依賴神的大力，直到被提上天；
12550,現在所望、所深信的，將來都必實現。
12551,我無能力，我的主，無法孤獨、孤獨的站立；
12552,我的軟弱成祝福，如果完全、完全倚靠祢。
12553,每一點，每一天，我是一樣需恩典；
12554,我仍一樣是無倚，求祢更多、更多顯自己。
12555,我的路途真孤苦，時常疲倦、疲倦不唱詩；
12556,我不認識我路途，祢能使我、使我不迷失。
12557,我的感覺常改變，一切可厭、可厭無價值；
12558,當我眼睛看不見，正是我主、我主最近時。
12559,我是孤單，我的主，不易喜樂、喜樂並忍耐；
12560,若無甘甜的眷顧，和祢祕密、祕密的同在。
12561,時日飛逝河水高，不久我要、我要橫渡過；
12562,四圍冷靜我獨禱，求祢記念、記念我軟弱。
12563,"Be not dismayed whate'er betide, God will take care of you!"
12564,"Beneath His wings of love abide, God will take care of you!"

12574,任何遭遇不要驚怕，神必定顧念你。
12575,神必定顧念你，時時顧念，處處顧念；
12576,神必定顧念你，神必定顧念你。

12583,"Hold Thou my hand! So weak I am, and helpless,"
12584,I dare not take one step without Thy aid;
12585,"Hold Thou my hand! For then, O loving Saviour,"
12586,No dread of ill shall make my soul afraid.
12587,"Hold Thou my hand! And closer, closer draw me"
12588,"To Thy dear self — my hope, my joy, my all;"
12589,"Hold Thou my hand, lest haply I should wander;"
12590,"And missing Thee, my trembling feet should fall."
12591,Hold Thou my hand! The way is dark before me
12592,Without the sunlight of Thy face Divine;
12593,"But when by faith I catch its radiant glory,"
12594,"What heights of joy, what rapturous songs are mine!"
12595,Hold Thou my hand! That when I reach the margin
12596,Of that lone river thou didst cross for me.
12597,"A heav'nly light flash along its waters,"
12598,And every wave like crystal bright shall be.
12599,緊握我手！我是這樣的無依，
12600,沒有扶助，一步我不敢走；
12601,緊握我手！親愛救主，
12602,求提攜，禍害恐嚇纔不使我戰抖。
12603,緊握我手！求袮更緊的拉我
12604,近袮自己，我一切中一切；
12605,緊握我手！免得偶然我流落，
12606,迷失了袮，我腳發輭滑跌。
12607,緊握我手！前面道路不豫曉，
12608,因為沒有袮臉上的亮光；
12609,但是當我藉信瞥見袮榮耀，
12610,我的喜樂立即發音成唱。
12611,緊握我手！當我走到袮為我
12612,所經過的黑河孤單邊界，
12613,屬天的光纔會照射到此河，
12614,其中黑水纔會不像黑夜。
12615,"Deep down into the depths of this Thy name,"
12616,"My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight;"
12617,"Thou art enough however long the day,"
12618,Thou art enough however dark the night.
12619,"Thou art enough, however great the trial;"
12620,"Thou art enough, however lone the scene."
12621,"With Thee alone, there's fullness of Thy joy;"
12622,"With Thee alone, there's singing of Thy song."
12623,"Thou art my God, the All-Sufficient One;"
12624,Thou canst create for me whate'er I lack.
12625,Thy mighty Hand has strewn the homeward track
12626,With miracles of love and tender care.
12627,"For me Thy trusting one, my God I dare"
12628,Once more to fly myself upon Thy breast
12629,And there adore Thy ways in faith's deep rest
12630,And there adore Thy ways in faith's quiet rest.
12631,神阿﹐祢名何等廣大泱漭﹗
12632,我今投身其中﹐心頂安然﹔
12633,有祢夠了﹐無論日有多長﹐
12634,有祢夠了﹐無論夜有多暗。
12635,有祢夠了﹐無論事多紛煩﹔
12636,有祢夠了﹐無論境多寂寞﹔
12637,有祢﹐我就已經能夠盡歡﹐
12638,有祢﹐我就已經能夠唱歌。
12639,祢是我神﹗全有﹗全足﹗全豐﹗
12640,祢能為我創造我所缺乏﹔
12641,有祢自己﹐在我回家途中﹐
12642,無論有何需要﹐都必無差。
12643,我的神阿﹐祢在已過路上﹐
12644,曾用愛的神蹟多方眷顧﹔
12645,故我敢再投入祢的胸膛﹐
12646,因信心安﹐讚美祢的道路。
12647,"I could not do without Thee! I cannot stand alone,"
12648,"I have no strength or goodness, no wisdom of my own."
12649,"But Thou, beloved Saviour, art all in all to me"
12650,"And weakness will be power, if leaning hard on Thee."
12651,"I could not do without Thee! For oh! the way is long,"
12652,"And I am often weary, and sigh replaces song."
12653,How could I do without Thee? I do not know the way;
12654,"Thou knowest and Thou leadest, and wilt not let me stray."
12655,"I could not do without Thee! Jesus, Saviour dear!"
12656,"E'en when my eyes are holden, I know that Thou art near."
12657,"How dreary and how lonely this changeful life would be,"
12658,"Without the sweet communion, the secret rest with Thee!"
12659,I could not do without Thee! No other friend can read
12660,"The spirit's strange deep longings, interpreting its need."
12661,"No human heart could enter each dim recess of mine,"
12662,"And soothe and hush and calm it, blessed Lord, but Thine!"
12663,"I could not do without Thee! For years are fleeting fast,"
12664,"And soon, in solemn loneliness, the river must be passed."
12665,"But Thou wilt never leave me, and, though the waves roll high,"
12666,"I know Thou wilt be near me, and whisper, ""It is I."""
12667,無袮，我就無法想，不能立定地位；
12668,我無力量和善良，我無自己智慧。
12669,但袮，親愛的救主，一切中的一切，
12670,輭弱要變成祝福，如果我被提挈。
12671,無袮，我就無法想，這路何等的長；
12672,我是疲倦身不強，歎息代替詩章。
12673,我怎可以能無袮？我並不能識路；
12674,但袮識路直到底，不肯讓我迷途。
12675,無袮，我就無法想，耶穌親愛救主；
12676,就是我眼無印象，袮仍親近無誤。
12677,何等孤單何等痛，在這生疏人地；
12678,若無甘甜的交通，若無袮的安息。
12679,無袮，我就無法想，無人能夠認識
12680,我靈奇深的意向，將它需要解釋；
12681,我心祕密的角落，無人能夠進入，
12682,來慰，來靜，並來託，只有袮能，我主！
12683,無袮，我就無法想，年日已經不多；
12684,我是須與人同樣孤獨渡河而過。
12685,但袮永遠不離開，不管浪有幾多；
12686,"我知袮仍要施愛，並低聲說：""是我。"""
12687,"Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father!"
12688,There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
12689,"Thou changest not; Thy compassions, they fail not;"
12690,As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.
12691,Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy faithfulness!
12692,Morning by morning new mercies I see;
12693,All I have needed Thy hand hath provided.
12694,"Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!"
12695,"Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,"
12696,"Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above"
12697,Join with all nature in manifold witness
12698,"To Thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love."
12699,"Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,"
12700,"Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide,"
12701,"Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,"
12702,"Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!"
12703,父阿﹐在祢並無轉動的影兒﹐
12704,祢的信實極其廣大無邊﹔
12705,千萬億載祢的恩惠永存在﹐
12706,祢的憐憫像祢永遠不變。
12707,祢信實何廣大﹗祢信實何廣大﹗

12709,凡所需祢聖手都豫備完全﹐
12710,祢的信實極其廣大無邊﹗
12711,冬夏時令﹐莊稼及時的供應﹐
12712,日月星辰﹐晝夜不斷運轉﹔
12713,祢的創造﹐多方都在作見證﹐
12714,祢的信實極其廣大無邊。
12715,祢的赦免﹐所給平安與喜樂﹐
12716,祢的同在﹐所賜安撫、引導﹔
12717,今日力量﹐明日光明的盼望﹐
12718,全都屬我﹐福分一無缺少。
12719,"Behold, Behold, God is my salvation,"
12720,"I will trust and not be afraid,"
12721,"Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, I'll not be afraid."
12722,看哪，看哪，神是我的拯救！
12723,我倚靠祂必不懼怕；
12724,哈利路亞，哈利路亞，哈利路亞，我必不懼怕。
12725,"I don't know about tomorrow, I just live from day to day;"
12726,"I don't borrow from its sunshine, for its skies may turn to gray."
12727,"I don't worry o'er the future, for I know what Jesus said;"
12728,"And today I'll walk beside Him, for He knows what is ahead."
12729,"Many things about tomorrow I don't seem to understand,"
12730,But I know who holds tomorrow and I know who holds my hand.
12731,I don't know about tomorrow; it may bring me poverty;
12732,But the One who feeds the sparrow is the One who stands by me.
12733,"And the path that be my portion may be through the flame or flood,"
12734,But His presence goes before me and I'm covered with His blood.
12735,Every step is getting brighter as the golden stairs I climb;
12736,"Every burden's getting lighter, every cloud is silver-lined."
12737,"There the sun is always shining, there no tear will dim the eye,"
12738,"At the ending of the rainbow, where the mountains touch the sky."
12739,我不知明日將如何﹐每時刻安然度過﹔
12740,我不求明天的陽光﹐因明天或轉陰暗。
12741,我不為將來而憂慮﹐因我知主所應許﹔
12742,今天我必與主同行﹐祂深知前途光景。
12743,許多事明天將臨到﹐許多事難以明瞭﹔
12744,但我知主掌握明天﹐祂必要領我向前。
12745,我不知明日將如何﹐或遭遇貧苦饑餓﹔
12746,那看顧麻雀的恩主﹐必隨我時刻看顧。
12747,我前程雖經歷水火﹐或快樂或有災禍﹔
12748,但我主引導我路途﹐祂寶血將我抹塗。
12749,每一步越走越光明﹐像攀登黃金階梯﹔
12750,每重擔越挑越輕省﹐每朵雲披上銀衣。
12751,在那裡陽光常普照﹐在那裡沒有眼淚﹔
12752,在美麗彩虹的盡頭﹐眾山嶺與天相連。
12753,"Blessed is he that is trusting the Lord, for the help that he daily needs;"

12760,Blessed is he whom the Father will aid. And the saviour will e'er befriend.
12761,"He shall not fear, and shall not be dismayed, for the Lord will his soul defend."
12762,Blessed is he who will keep in the way. That will upward and onward lead;
12763,"Walking by faith in His love every day, who supplieth his daily need."
12764,誰若倚靠耶和華，真有福，必得著應時的幫助；

12787,Pray and thy path will be clear.
12788,Never be sad or desponding;
12789,There is a morrow for thee.
12790,Soon thou shalt dwell in its brightness;
12791,There with the Lord thou shalt be.
12792,"Lean on the arm of thy Lord,"
12793,Dwell in the depths of His mercy;
12794,Thou shalt receive thy reward.
12795,永不灰心﹐永不沮喪﹐

12800,永不因愁苦而灰心﹐
12801,主能使天光照臨。
12802,專心靠主﹐專心靠主﹐
12803,試煉中仍歌唱不住﹐
12804,剛強壯膽信靠主。
12805,雖你有重擔壓心頭﹐
12806,雖你生活滿苦憂﹔
12807,仰望主必得祂恩光﹐
12808,求主開路可前往。
12809,黑夜過必露晨光﹔
12810,不久﹐在榮光照耀處﹐
12811,你要與主永同住。
12812,主膀臂是你依傍﹔
12813,常在主深恩中躲藏﹐
12814,直等那日得獎賞。
12815,"I'm a pilgrim and a stranger. Rough and thorny is the road,"
12816,"Often in the midst of danger, but it leads to God."
12817,"Clouds and darkness oft distress me, great and many are my foes;"
12818,"Anxious cares and thoughts oppress me, but my Father knows."
12819,"Oh, how sweet is this assurance, 'mid the conflict and the strife!"
12820,Although sorrows past endurance follow me through life.
12821,"Home in prospect still can cheer me, yes, and give me sweet repose,"
12822,While I feel His presence near me; for my Father knows
12823,"Yes, He sees and knows me duly, watches over me in love;"
12824,Sends me help when foes assail me — bids me look above.
12825,"Soon my journey will be ended, life is drawing to a close;"
12826,I shall then be well attended; this my Father knows.
12827,I shall then with joy behold Him — face to face my Father see;

12829,Nothing more shall then distress me in the land of sweet repose;
12830,Jesus stand engaged to bless me; this my Father knows.
12831,我是一個異鄉旅客，跋涉遙遠的道路；
12832,雖然有時遇見阻隔，引我親天父。
12833,途中雖有烏雲籠罩，也有意外的打擾；
12834,思慮、煩惱把我壓倒，但我父知道。
12835,父是知道，何等保證！沿途試煉有何害？
12836,縱然它們隨我一生，不容易忍耐。
12837,家已在望，莫大鼓勵，使我安息不動搖！
12838,祂的同在何其甜蜜，我天父知道。
12839,我父每日都知道我，看守我在愛裏面；
12840,艱難來襲，祂來助我，叫我往上看。
12841,不久旅程到達止境，今生就要告終了，
12842,我將如何進入光明，這事父知道。
12843,那時我在父的面前，親眼看見祂慈顏；
12844,滿心歡喜，俯伏朝見，感謝祂恩典。
12845,在那甜美安息之地，再無意外的攪擾；
12846,神的應許全得應驗，這事父知道。
12847,"Simply trusting every day, trusting thro' a stormy way;"

12871,哦，何等奇妙，奇妙安息！
12872,全然倚靠主，我便蒙福祉；
12873,每逢遇災害，主安慰護庇，
12874,使我安穩在祂大能膀臂。

13156,耶穌是我牧者，我識祂聲音！
13157,一聽祂的召呼，喜樂滿我心！
13158,雖然有時責備，祂聲仍柔細；
13159,只有祂能領我，我原是祂的。
13160,耶穌是我牧者，曾為羊捨命；
13161,群羊都灑上血，污穢得潔淨。
13162,又在羊的身上，蓋上祂印記：
13163,凡有祂的靈者，都是屬祂的。
13164,耶穌是我牧者，能手常護我，
13165,縱遇豺狼怒嗥，無一能害我；
13166,雖過幽谷死蔭，黑暗深可怖，
13167,我無絲毫懼怕，完全勝墳墓。
13168,The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want.
13169,He maketh me to lie down
13170,"In green pastures; He leadeth me,"
13171,He leadeth me beside the still waters.
13172,He restoreth my soul;
13173,He leadeth me in the paths
13174,"Of righteousness for His name's sake,"
13175,For His name's sake.
13176,"Yea, though I walk through the valley of"
13177,"The shadow of death, I will fear no evil;"
13178,"For Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff,"
13179,"They comfort me, they comfort me."
13180,Thou preparest a table before me
13181,In the presence of mine enemies;
13182,Thou anointest my head with oil;
13183,My cup runneth over.
13184,Surely goodness and mercy
13185,Shall follow me all the days
13186,"Of my life, goodness and mercy"
13187,Shall follow me all the days of my life;
13188,And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
13189,"Forever and ever,"
13190,And I will dwell in the house of the Lord for
13191,Ever and ever.
13192,耶和華是我的牧者﹐
13193,我必不至缺乏。
13194,祂使我躺臥在青草地上﹐
13195,領我在可安歇的水邊。
13196,祂使我的靈魂甦醒﹐
13197,為自己的名引導我走義路﹐
13198,引導我走義路。
13199,我雖然行過死陰的幽谷﹐
13200,也不怕遭害﹐因為祢
13201,與我同在﹔祢的杖﹐
13202,祢的竿﹐都安慰我。

13350,苞雖難免生澀帶苦，花卻必定芳甘。
13351,盲目不信必致錯誤，觀察必定昏迷；
13352,惟神是祂自己證明，祂必證明一切。

13498,"Let this promise be thy answer: ""I will guide thee with Mine eye."""
13499,"When temptations almost win thee, and thy trusted watchers fly,"
13500,"Let this promise ring within thee: ""I will guide thee with Mine eye."""
13501,"When thy secret hopes have perish'd in the grave of years gone by,"
13502,"Let this promise still be cherish'd: ""I will guide thee with Mine eye."""
13503,"When the shades of life are falling, and the hour has come to die;"
13504,"Hear thy trusted Leader calling, ""I will guide thee with Mine eye."""
13505,"So rejoice in Christ thy treasure, all thy needs He will supply;"
13506,"Live each day to seek His pleasure, let Him guide thee with His eye."
13507,從地去天疲倦客旅，半途停頓思安息；
13508,"神曾賜下寶貴應許：""我用眼睛引導你。"""
13509,"""我要引導，我要引導，我用眼睛引導你；"
13510,"從地去天疲倦客旅，我用眼晴引導你。"""
13511,雖然心中常是紛亂，情緒擾人欲昏迷；
13512,"但有應許排解萬難：""我用眼睛引導你。"""
13513,雖然試探幾乎得勝，可靠親友也遠離；

13515,你的暗中盼望消逝，埋在年日墳墓裏；
13516,"讓這應許將你支持：""我用眼睛引導你。"""
13517,生命陰影逐漸加深，要穿榮耀的身體；
13518,"神這應許顯為更真：""我用眼睛引導你。"""
13519,但願我靈以神為樂，我心以祂為至寶；
13520,與祂交通一無間隔，常得眼睛的引導。
13521,"I'll sing of the wonderful promise, that Jesus has given to me;"
13522,"""My strength is made perfect in weakness, my grace is sufficient for thee."""
13523,"And lest my poor heart should forget it, or ever forgetful should be,"
13524,"He still keeps repeating the promise, ""My grace is sufficient for thee."""

13526,"""My strength is made perfect in weakness. My grace is sufficient for thee."""
13527,"His grace is sufficient to save me, and cleanse me from guilt and from sin;"
13528,"Sufficient to sanctify wholly, and give me His Spirit within."
13529,"His grace is sufficient for trials, no matter how hard they may be,"
13530,"This promise stands over against them: ""My grace is sufficient for thee,"""
13531,"His grace is sufficient for sickness, sustaining and making me whole;"
13532,His grace is sufficient when sorrows like billows roll over the soul.
13533,"His grace is sufficient for service, it sets us form selfishness free,"
13534,"And sends us to tell to the tried ones, His grace is sufficient for thee."
13535,"His grace is sufficient to live by, and should we be summoned to die,"
13536,"'Twill light up the valley of shadows, and bear us away to Him nigh."
13537,"Or when we shall stand in His vict'ry, and Christ in His glory shall see,"
13538,"We'll fall at His footstool confessing: ""Thy grace was sufficient for me."""
13539,"It is not our grace that's sufficient, but His grace, it ever must be;"
13540,"Our grace are transient and changing, His grace is unfailing as He."
13541,And so I am ever repeating His wonderful promise to me:
13542,我要歌唱那奇妙應許，就是耶穌親口所說：
13543,"""我的恩典是夠你使用，我的能力顯於輭弱。"""
13544,惟恐我這惡心會忘記，忘記這應許的光榮，
13545,"所以祂一直一直的說：""我的恩典夠你使用。"""
13546,是的，救主一直對我說，一直，一直，一直的說：
13547,祂的恩典夠使我得救，脫離罪惡得著新心；
13548,夠使我靈、魂、體都聖潔，並且滿有主的聖靈。
13549,祂的恩典夠助我經過各種試煉，無論多兇；
13550,"祂的應許抵擋了它們，""我的恩典夠你使用。"""
13551,祂的恩典夠為我疾病：一面扶持，一面施醫；
13552,祂的恩典夠助我經過一切苦楚，一切攻擊。
13553,祂的恩典是夠我工作，使我能夠幫助弟兄；
13554,並使他們與我同知道，祂的恩典足夠使用。
13555,祂的恩典是夠我生活，我若要離此世生涯；
13556,它要發光照亮死蔭谷，逐步帶領我回到家。
13557,在那邊當我看見救主-祂的美麗，祂的光榮，
13558,"我就要俯伏並承認說：""袮的恩典夠我使用。"""
13559,我們的恩典並不夠用，夠用，惟有祂的恩典；
13560,我們的，常是曇花一現，但是祂的，永不改變。
13561,因此我就不斷的背誦祂曾對我親口所說：
13562,"""我的恩典是夠你使用，我的能力顯在輭弱。"""
13563,"Whosoever will to the Lord may come, whosoever will to the Lord may come,"
13564,"Whosoever will to the Lord may come, He'll not turn one away."
13565,"Jesus, Jesus heals the broken hearted, Jesus, Jesus heals the broken hearted,"
13566,"Jesus, Jesus heals the broken hearted, He will set you free."
13567,無論誰願意信靠主，可來！無論誰願意信靠主，可來！
13568,無論誰願意信靠主，可來！沒有一個撇開！
13569,耶穌，耶穌，醫治破碎心懷，耶穌，耶穌，醫治破碎心懷，
13570,耶穌，耶穌，醫治破碎心懷，將捆鎖解開。
13600,"In heav'nly love abiding, no change my heart shall fear;"
13601,"And safe is such confiding, for nothing changes here."
13602,The storm may roar without me; my heart may low be laid;
13603,But God is round about me; and can I be dismayed?
13604,"Wherever He may guide me, no want shall turn me back;"
13605,"My Shepherd is beside me, and nothing can I lack:"
13606,"His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim;"
13607,"He knows the way He taketh, and I will walk with Him."
13608,"Green pastures are before me, which yet I have not seen;"
13609,"Bright skies will soon be o'er me, where the dark clouds have been."
13610,"My hope I cannot measure, my path of life is free;"
13611,"My Saviour has my treasure, and He will walk with me."
13612,我常居住天愛中，不怕改變一點；
13613,如此把握不落空，在此沒有改變。
13614,也許狂風四面起，也許無多希望；
13615,但神四面來護庇，我怎能夠徬徨？
13616,窮困難迫我回頭，任主領我何方；
13617,我不至有何不夠，我的牧人在旁。
13618,祂的慧心常清醒，祂的明眼不眛；
13619,祂知祂行的路徑，我要始終跟隨。
13620,青草地場尚在前，是我從所未見；
13621,再過就是晴朗天，今雖稠雲綿綿。
13622,我的希望真久長，我的途徑光明；
13623,救主掌握我寶藏，祂要和我同行。
13624,或許明朝天未曉，我靈不及等待，
13625,就脫肉體全不要，主，就與袮同在。
13626,安息！睡眠！何寶貴，有袮保護照顧；
13627,或許袮忽榮耀歸，召我座前相晤！
13628,那時看見袮自己，被眾選民擁擠；
13629,又是榮耀，又美麗，又是歌唱無已。
13630,奇妙應許的日期，我們能夠同袮
13631,永遠享受神安息，永遠喜樂滿意。

13645,在此祂愛常覆翼，我得甜美安息。
13646,這是天來的音樂，經由詩歌傾吐；
13647,飄過榮耀的天野，飄過碧玉之土。
13648,安穩在耶穌手臂，安穩脫離掛礙；
13649,脫離試探與攻擊，在此罪不為害。
13650,脫離痛苦的熬煎，脫離疑惑、驚畏；
13651,只有幾個小試煉，只有幾滴眼淚。
13652,耶穌是我避難所，耶穌為我受死；

13710,"Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day,"
13711,Perfect yet it growth deeper all the way.
13712,"Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest;"
13713,"Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest."
13714,"Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,"
13715,"Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;"
13716,"Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,"
13717,Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.
13718,"Every joy or trial falleth from above,"
13719,Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love;
13720,We may trust Him fully all for us to do;
13721,They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.
13722,神完全的平安，像長江大河；
13723,不斷向前淹漫，全勝不退落。
13724,完全，卻是天天越流越深浡；
13725,完全，卻是面面越流越廣闊。
13726,堅定倚靠救主，必全然蒙福，
13727,得祂應許護庇，完全的安息。
13728,藏在祂恩手中-何等的護庇！
13729,仇敵無法追蹤，對頭難站立。
13730,無擔憂的波濤，無掛慮黑影；
13731,無慌張的風暴能攪擾我靈。
13732,每喜樂或憂傷，皆從天下降；
13733,隨著愛的太陽，畫我晷儀上。
13734,我的所有辦法，就是全心信；
13735,誰是全心靠祂，必識祂全真。
13736,"When peace like a river attendeth my way,"
13737,When sorrows like sea billows roll;
13738,"Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say,"
13739,"""It is well, it is well with my soul!"""
13740,"It is well with my soul! It is well, it is well with my soul!"
13741,"Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,"
13742,Let this blest assurance control:
13743,That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate
13744,And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
13745,"My sin — oh, the bliss of this glorious thought —"
13746,My sin — not in part but the whole —
13747,"Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more."
13748,"Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!"
13749,"For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live;"
13750,"Though Jordan about me shall roll,"
13751,"No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life,"
13752,Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.
13753,"And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,"
13754,"The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,"
13755,"The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend."
13756,"""Even so"" — it is well with my soul."
13757,平安如水流﹐正一路跟隨我﹐
13758,憂慮如怒濤勢橫湧﹔
13759,任何的遭遇﹐祢已教我能說﹕
13760,我的魂﹐當安息﹐無所恐﹗
13761,哦﹐我魂﹐可無恐﹗哦﹐我魂﹐可安息﹐可無恐﹗
13762,撒但雖肆虐﹐試煉雖如烈火﹐
13763,我心﹐你應當有把握﹔
13764,因主明瞭我是何等的軟弱﹐
13765,已流出祂寶血為著我。
13766,我罪﹐哦﹐這是何等榮耀思想﹐
13767,我罪﹐非局部﹐是一切
13768,釘在祂十架﹐不壓在我身上﹐
13769,哦﹐我魂﹐當歌頌﹐當稱謝。
13770,活著是基督﹐是主基督執政﹐
13771,"即使約但河起波瀾,"
13772,我也無痛苦﹐雖經死猶如生﹐
13773,"仍聽祂低聲說﹕""你平安。"""
13774,哦﹐主﹐我救主﹐我等候祢再臨﹐
13775,我眼是望天﹐不望墓﹔
13776,哦﹐號筒吹響﹐哦﹐我主的聲音﹗
13777,哦﹐何等的盼望﹐何等福﹗
13778,"Tho' the angry surges roll on my tempest driven soul,"
13779,"I am peaceful, for I know, wildly though the winds may blow,"
13780,"I've an anchor safe and sure, that can ever more endure."
13781,"And it holds, my anchor holds; blow your wildest, then, O gale,"
13782,"On my bark so small and frail, by His grace I shall not fail,"
13783,"For my anchor holds, my anchor holds."
13784,"Mighty tides about me sweep, perils lurk within the deep,"
13785,"Angry clouds o'er-shade the sky, and the tempest rises high;"
13786,"Still I stand the tempest's shock, for my anchor grips the Rock."
13787,"I can feel the anchor fast as I meet each sudden blast,"
13788,"And the cable, though unseen, bears the heavy strain between;"
13789,"Thro' the storm I safely ride, till the turning of the tide."
13790,Troubles almost 'whelm the soul; griefs like billows o'er me roll:
13791,Tempters seek to lure astray; storms obscure the light of day;
13792,"But in Christ I can be bold, I've an anchor that shall hold."
13793,波浪怒濤勢洶湧，滾滾欲吞我驚魂，
13794,狂風怒號聲可怖，但我已知得安穩；
13795,因我有一堅固錨，永永遠遠不動搖！
13796,任你風急浪又高，我錨已經安然拋，
13797,雖我人輕船又小，靠主恩典不動搖，
13798,我錨穩固安全又可靠。
13799,雖然浪潮如山倒，隱伏危機四圍繞；
13800,雖然滿天烏雲罩，雖然風暴雨又狂；
13801,安然站立不動搖，我錨緊拋磐石上。
13802,風浪交加愈緊迫，愈覺我錨真牢靠；
13803,眼不能見信心鍊，緊繫我心抗狂瀾；
13804,使我能駕風暴上，直到風暴全止消。
13805,憂患幾乎漫我魂，傷痛猶如浪滾滾；
13806,正當惡者在引誘，正當風雨掩日頭；
13807,我靠基督能強勇，因我有一堅固錨！
13808,"Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to Thy bosom fly,"
13809,"While the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high;"
13810,"Hide me, O my saviour hide, till the storm of life is past;"
13811,Safe in to the haven guide; O receive my soul at last.
13812,"Other refuge have I none, hangs my helpless soul on Thee;"
13813,"Leave, oh, leave me not alone, still support and comfort me."
13814,"All my trust on Thee is stayed, all my help from Thee I bring;"
13815,Cover my defenseless head with the shadow of Thy wing.
13816,"Thou, O Christ, art all I want; more than all in Thee I find;"
13817,"Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, heal the sick and lead the blind."
13818,"Just and holy is Thy name, I am all unrighteousness;"
13819,"Vile and full of sin I am, Thou art full of truth and grace."
13820,"Plenteous grace with Thee is found, grace to cover all my sin;"
13821,Let the healing streams abound; make and keep me pure within.
13822,"Thou of life the fountain art, freely let me take of Thee;"
13823,"Spring Thou up within my heart, rise to all eternity."
13824,耶穌，靈魂的愛人，求袮許我來藏身；
13825,正當波浪滾滾近，正當風雨陣陣緊。
13826,藏我，哦主，求藏我，直到今生風波過；
13827,引我平安進天門，至終求接我靈魂！
13828,我無別的逃避所，無助靈魂向袮託；
13829,求主莫將我丟棄，安慰保守無時已。
13830,所有倚靠寄袮身，所有救助在袮恩；
13831,我頭無遮、身無蔽，求袮聖翼來覆庇。
13832,主阿，袮是我所需，夠我一切還有餘；
13833,輭弱、跌倒袮扶持，疾病、瞎眼袮醫治。
13834,袮名至義、至聖潔，我全不義滿罪孽；
13835,我是邪惡沒良善，真理、恩典袮充滿。
13836,袮前我遇浩大恩，恩足赦免我罪深；
13837,醫治活水望湧流，使我清潔蒙保守。
13838,袮是永遠生命源，望在我心成活泉；
13839,從我裏面來湧流，一直湧流到永久。
13840,"O eyes that are weary and hearts that are sore,"
13841,"Look off unto Jesus, and sorrow no more;"
13842,"The light of His countenance shineth so bright,"
13843,That on earth as in heaven there need be no night.
13844,"Looking off unto Jesus, my eyes cannot see"
13845,The troubles and dangers that throng around me;
13846,They cannot be blinded with sorrowful tears;
13847,They cannot be shadow'd with unbelieving fears.
13848,"Looking off unto Jesus, my spirit is blest;"
13849,"In the world I have turmoil, in Him I have rest."
13850,The sea of my life all about me may roar;
13851,"When I look unto Jesus, I hear it no more."
13852,"Looking off unto Jesus, I go not astray;"
13853,"My eyes are on Him, and He shows me the way."
13854,"The path may seem dark as He leads me along,"
13855,"But following Jesus, I cannot go wrong."
13856,"Looking off unto Jesus, until in Heav'n I see"
13857,The full beauty and grace of Jesus my Lord.
13858,I shall know how His love went before me each day
13859,And wonder that ever my eyes turned away.
13860,你這因著奔正路，手垂腿酸之人，
13861,望斷以及於耶穌，免得疲倦煩悶；
13862,祂的面光照輝煌，驅盡黑暗不見，
13863,你若仰望祂面光，就必輝煌如天。
13864,望斷以及於耶穌，你就必不看見
13865,逼迫、艱難與貧苦，如何四圍為患；

13872,望斷以及於耶穌，你就不會迷糊，
13873,你若向祂常舉目，祂必指你正路；
13874,當祂領你向前走，即使遇到雲霧，
13875,你若向祂常仰首，祂必不會錯誤。
13876,望斷以及於耶穌，直到被提上天，
13877,直到榮耀的面目，完全顯你眼前；
13878,今日仰望之榮面，使你途中得力，
13879,那日變作你歌頌，使你永遠歡喜。
13880,"Not now, but in the coming years,"
13881,It may be when with Christ we stand.
13882,"We'll read the meaning of our tears,"
13883,"And there, sometime, we'll understand."
13884,Then trust in God thro' all thy days;
13885,"Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;"
13886,"Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,"
13887,"Sometime, sometime we'll understand."
13888,"We'll catch the broken thread again,"
13889,And finish what we here began;
13890,"God will the mysteries explain,"
13891,"And then, ah, then, we'll understand."
13892,We'll know why clouds instead of sun
13893,Were over many a cherished plan;
13894,Why song has ceased when scarce begun;
13895,"'Tis then, sometime, we'll understand."
13896,"Why what we long for most of all,"
13897,Eludes so oft our eager hand;
13898,"Why hopes are crushed and castles fall,"
13899,"Up there, sometime, we'll understand."
13900,"God knows the way, He holds the key,"
13901,He guides us with unerring hand;
13902,"Sometime with tearless eyes we'll see,"
13903,"Yes, then, 'tis then, we'll understand."
13904,不在此時，許在將來，
13905,不在這裏，許在美地，
13906,我們纔能完全領會歎息、
13907,眼淚所有意義。
13908,你當一生信靠救主，
13909,不必懼怕，主在攙扶；
13910,路雖陰暗，仍當讚美，
13911,有日，有日都要領會。
13912,中斷線索，都將接上，
13913,一生經過，必有路軌；
13914,天能解釋各樣祕藏，
13915,那日，那日都必領會。
13916,何故厚雲遮蔽太陽？
13917,何故寂寞代替安慰？
13918,何故歎息多過歌唱？
13919,有日，我們就要領會。
13920,何以祈求未見答應？
13921,何以將成終又不遂？
13922,何以盼望終成泡影？
13923,那日，那裏，我必領會。
13924,神知我路，手拿它鑰，
13925,祂的帶領充滿智慧；
13926,有日我眼看見一切，
13927,就在那日，我必領會。
14056,"Weary pilgrim on life's pathway, Struggling on beneath thy load,"
14057,"Hear these words of consolation, ""Cast thy burden on the Lord."""
14058,Cast thy burden on the Lord! Cast thy burden on the Lord!
14059,"And He will strengthen thee, Sustain and comfort thee."
14060,Cast thy burden on the Lord.
14061,Are thy tired feet unsteady? Does thy lamp no light afford?
14062,"Is thy cross too great and heavy? ""Cast thy burden on the Lord."""
14063,Are the ties of friendship severed? Hushed the voices fondly heard?
14064,"Breaks thy heart with weight of anguish? ""Cast thy burden on the Lord."""
14065,Does thy heart with faintness falter? Does thy mind forget His word?
14066,"Does thy strength succumb to weakness? ""Cast thy burden on the Lord."""
14067,He will hold thee up from falling; He will guide thy steps aright;
14068,He will strengthen each endeavor; He will keep thee by His might.
14069,路途遙遠，負擔沉重，力盡身疲想回家；
14070,請聽主聲，柔然輕說：重擔當託耶和華。
14071,重擔當託耶和華，重擔當託耶和華，
14072,主會安慰你，又會堅固你，
14073,重擔當託耶和華。
14074,雙腳已輭，雙手已酸，燈火將滅，目又花；
14075,眼見就要心灰氣短，重擔當託耶和華。
14076,親友離散，遭遇淒涼，憂心難解常懸掛；
14077,一身難受如此創傷，重擔當託耶和華。
14078,孤單輭弱，無所傍倚，心緒起落亂如麻；
14079,都是因為我們忘記重擔當託耶和華。
14080,祂會安慰，祂會堅固，祂要使你力有加，
14081,祂要使你心境安舒，重擔當託耶和華。
14082,"The cross that He gave may be heavy, but it ne'er out-weighs His grace;"
14083,"The storm that I feared may surround me, but it ne'er excludes His face."
14084,"The Cross is not greater than His grace,"
14085,The storm can not hide His blessed face; I am satisfied to know
14086,"That with Jesus here below, I can conquer ev'ry foe."
14087,The thorns in my path are not sharper than composed His crown for me;
14088,The cup that I drink not more bitter than He drank in Gethsemane.
14089,"The light of His love shineth brighter, as it falls on paths of woe;"
14090,"The toil of my work groweth lighter, as I stoop to raise the low."
14091,"His will I have joy in fulfilling, as I'm walking in His sight;"
14092,"My all to the blood I am bringing, it alone can keep me right."
14093,祂賜的十架雖然沉重，不會重逾祂恩典；
14094,我怕的風波雖然洶湧，不致掩蔽祂榮臉。
14095,十架不會重逾祂恩典，
14096,風波不會掩蔽祂榮臉；我心歡樂，因我知
14097,有主耶穌同在此，我就勝過敵權勢。
14098,我路上荊棘，並不會比祂頭上的荊冕利；
14099,我喝的苦杯，還遠不及祂的在客西馬尼。
14100,祂光照耀得更加昭明，在危難的道路中；
14101,我擔子變得更為省輕，當我為人來任重。
14102,我今生活在祂的面前，歡然順服祂旨意；
14103,我知我所受各種試煉，都是化裝的福庇。

14108,"Troubled soul, the Saviour can see ev'ry heartache and tear."
14109,日日充滿憂傷重擔，心中苦悶孤單；
14110,重擔可解脫在加略山，耶穌何等親近。
14111,重擔可解脫在加略山，加略山，加略山；
14112,今向主交託你重擔-一切恐懼、愁煩；
14113,主看見你一切艱難-眼淚、苦痛、悲歎；
14114,"God is still on the throne, And He will remember His own;"
14115,"Though trials may press us and burdens distress us, He never will leave us alone."

14119,雖有暫時風浪，雖有撒但虛謊，祂必不會叫你獨當。
14120,神仍坐著為王，祂必將你記在心上；祂不會說謊，
14121,也不將你遺忘，神仍坐著為王。
14122,"God hath not promised skies always blue,"
14123,Flower strewn pathways all our lives thro';
14124,"God hath not promised sun without rain,"
14125,"Joy without sorrow, peace without pain."
14126,"But God hath promised strength for the day,"
14127,"Rest for the labor, light for the way,"
14128,"Grace for the trials, help from above,"
14129,"Unfailing kind-ness, undying love."
14130,God hath not promised we shall not know
14131,"Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;"
14132,He hath not told us we shall not bear
14133,"Many a burden, many a care."
14134,"God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,"
14135,"Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;"
14136,"Never a mountain, rocky and steep,"
14137,"Never a river, turbid and deep."
14138,神未曾應許：天色常藍，
14139,人生的路途花香常漫；
14140,神未曾應許：常晴無雨，
14141,常樂無痛苦，常安無虞。
14142,神卻曾應許:生活有力，
14143,行路有光亮，作工得息，
14144,試煉得恩勗，危難有賴，
14145,無限的體諒，不死的愛。
14146,神未曾應許：我們不遇
14147,苦難和試探，懊惱、憂慮；
14148,神未曾應許：我們不負
14149,許多的重擔，許多事務。
14150,神未曾應許：前途盡是
14151,平坦的大路，任意驅馳；
14152,沒有深水拒-汪洋一片，
14153,沒有大山阻-高薄雲天。

14159,"Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure;"
14160,"Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying-"
14161,Earth has no sorrow that heav'n cannot cure.
14162,Here see the Bread of Life; see waters flowing
14163,"Forth from the throne of God, pure from above;"
14164,"Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing"
14165,Earth has no sorrow but heav'n can remove.
14166,來罷，憂傷的人，隨帶你煩惱，
14167,向著施恩寶座虔誠屈膝；
14168,來陳你心創痕，來訴你困擾，
14169,地無一個憂傷天不能醫。
14170,孤單中的喜樂，迷途的光照，
14171,痛悔者的希望-祂永不變；
14172,保惠師正在此柔聲的說道：
14173,地無一個憂傷天不能遣。
14174,這是生命的餅，滋養又甘甜，
14175,這是生命的水，流自寶座；
14176,來赴主的愛筵，心中常思念：

14192,神的路是正路，雖我不明瞭，
14193,為何憂愁試煉，常把我環繞；
14194,主用各樣方法，煉我像精金，
14195,故我謙卑信靠，我至聖救主。
14196,神的路是正路，神的路是善路，
14197,我願經常倚靠，惟神知最好！
14198,神的路是善路，計劃我道路，
14199,我願時常倚靠，憑祂手攙扶；

14222,"In every way there is a cross, that I might lean on Thee."
14223,A lowly heart will find each place a paradise for me.
14224,"And if some things I ask not in my cup of blessing be,"
14225,I'd have my spirit filled the more with grateful love to Thee;
14226,"More careful-not to serve Thee much, but please Thee perfectly."
14227,"In service which Thy will appoints, there are no bonds for me;"
14228,My inmost heart is taught the truth that makes Thy children free;
14229,A life of self-renouncing love is one of liberty.
14230,父，我知道我的一生袮已替我分好，
14231,所有必須發生變更，我不害怕看到；
14232,我求袮賜長久忠誠，存心討袮歡笑。
14233,"我求要得""有意""的愛，時常儆醒的慧，"
14234,常以笑容歡迎事態，擦乾不禁眼淚，
14235,心能與它自己合拍，好來同情、安慰。
14236,我不要有不安意志，急忙到東到西，
14237,要求要作幾件大事，或要明白祕密；
14238,我要被待如同孩子，所往都是受意。
14239,無論我在世界何地，是有何種情況，
14240,我與人心有個交契，我要保守發旺，
14241,我要為愛出我微力，為著事奉我王。
14242,我求袮賜每日恩澤，使我能常受教；
14243,心能從裏與外調和，當我與袮契交；
14244,滿意只佔微小旁側，若袮能得榮耀。
14245,每條路上都有虛假，是袮要我忍耐；
14246,每種境遇都有十架，是袮引我倚賴；
14247,但心靠袮若是卑下，無論那裏，可愛。
14248,如果在我幸福之中，有何尚未求祈，
14249,我是渴慕我的內衷，向袮能滿愛意；
14250,寧願不多為袮作工，完全使袮歡喜。
14251,袮愛所定我的選擇，不是我的捆繩；
14252,我在暗中受袮領帥，已識袮的見證：
14253,一生充滿捨己的愛，就是自由一生。
14254,"O soul, are you weary and troubled?"
14255,No light in the darkness you see?
14256,There's light for a look at the Saviour
14257,And life more abundant and free.
14258,"Turn your eyes upon Jesus,"
14259,"Look full in His wonderful face,"
14260,"And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,"
14261,In the light of His glory and grace.
14262,Thro' death into life everlasting
14263,"He passed, and we follow Him there."
14264,"O'er us sin no more hath dominion,"
14265,For more than conqu'rors we are!
14266,"His word shall not fail you, He promised;"
14267,Believe Him and all will be well;
14268,"Then go to a world that is dying,"
14269,His perfect salvation to tell!
14270,"暗中摸索無一線亮光,"
14271,何等疲乏﹐何等憂愁﹗
14272,一見主面就立刻明朗﹐
14273,生命豐盛加上自由。
14274,當轉眼仰望耶穌﹐
14275,注目仰望祂的慈容﹐
14276,所有事物在祂榮耀光中﹐
14277,都要次第變色成朦朧。
14278,經過死亡方能得生命﹐
14279,祂已前行﹐我們隨趨﹔
14280,罪能現今已經失權柄﹐
14281,因為我們得勝有餘。
14282,祂的應許從不至落空﹐
14283,祂是全能﹐祂是都肯﹔
14284,我們應當進到世人中﹐
14285,盡力顯明祂的救恩。
14286,當我在於最暗時間，測視人生變化；
14287,其中照出安慰光線，荊棘雜生香花。
14288,主，教我來緊握袮手，當我憂苦加添；
14289,從這低處使我看透，直至平安高天。
14290,不管任何地的歡樂，袮手加以否定；
14291,但願在袮施恩寶座，讓我如此求情：
14292,"""賜我安靜感激的心，脫離任何怨聲；"
14293,"賜我恩典，能力充盈，使我為袮而生。"""
14294,袮是屬我，甜美盼望，陪伴我的一生；
14295,袮的同在，照耀輝煌我的一生路程！
14296,Does Jesus care when my heart is pained too deeply for mirth and song;
14297,"As the burdens press and the cares distress, and the way grows weary and long?"
14298,"O yes, He cares; I know He cares, His heart is touched with my grief;"
14299,"When the days are weary, the long nights dreary, I know my Saviour cares."
14300,Does Jesus care when my way is dark with a nameless dread and fear?
14301,"As the daylight fades into deep night shades, does He care enough to be near?"
14302,Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed to resist some temptation strong;
14303,"When for my deep grief I find no relief, though my tears flow all the night long?"
14304,"Does Jesus care when I've said goodby to the dearest on earth to me,"
14305,And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks- is it aught to Him? Does He see?
14306,主顧念嗎？當我心痛傷，不再喜笑與歡唱；
14307,當重壓難當，道路阻且長，主耶穌是否仍顧念？
14308,祂必顧念，祂必顧念，因祂同情我憂楚；
14309,雖白晝苦難訴，黑夜長難度，我知祂仍顧念。
14310,主顧念嗎？當我路不明，心中有莫名駭驚；
14311,當日光消逝，當黑影來迎，主耶穌是否仍顧念？
14312,主顧念嗎？當我屢失敗，敵不住試探苦害；
14313,當無何事物能解我悲哀，主耶穌是否仍顧念？
14314,主顧念嗎？當我心無力與我所最愛別離；
14315,當我心絞痛，止不住哭泣，主耶穌是否仍顧念？
14316,"A mid the trials that I meet, a mid the thorns that pierce my feet,"
14317,"One thought remains supremely sweet: Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!"
14318,"Thou thinkest, Lord, of me! Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!"
14319,"What need I fear when Thou art near, and thinkest, Lord, of me!"
14320,"The cares of life come thronging fast, upon my soul their shadows cast;"
14321,"Their gloom reminds my heart at last — Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!"
14322,"Let shadows come, let shadows go, let life be bright, or dark with woe,"
14323,"I am content, for this I know — Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!"
14324,當我遇見試煉災殃，經過荊棘豺狼之疆，
14325,我有一個甘美思想，就是主懷念我。
14326,主，祢正懷念我。主，祢正懷念我。
14327,我怕甚麼？有祢親近，並且還懷念我！
14328,今生憂慮、苦難、折磨，使我心思都變昏黑；
14329,但是苦境使我記得：主，祢正懷念我。
14330,所以，無論愁雲多少，無論安樂，或是苦惱，
14331,我已滿足，因我知道：主還是懷念我。
14332,主已知道你的挫折!
14333,主已知道你的輭弱!
14334,主全知道你的無告！
14335,主的話說：我已知道。
14336,祂知你能受甚試煉，
14337,祂知你是需何恩典；
14338,祂早知你所有遭遇，
14339,祂是你主，何必疑懼。
14340,雖然多人譏諷、反對，
14341,親友離棄，旅伴誤會；
14342,但祂深知你的一切，
14343,有主知道，你可安歇。
14344,重擔只要交託給主，
14345,嘆息只要向祂傾吐；
14346,祂心愛你，知你憂苦，
14347,祂必施恩，祂必看顧。
14348,主既知道，足慰我心，
14349,主既知道，我便歡欣！
14350,主既知道，祂必搭救！
14351,主既知道，我還何求？
14352,"Precious Lord, take my hand, lead me on, help me stand,"
14353,"I am tired, I am weak, I am worn;"
14354,"Thro' the storm, thro' the night, lead me on to the light;"
14355,"Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home."
14356,"When my way grows drear, Precious Lord, linger near;"
14357,"When my life is almost gone,"
14358,"Hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall;"
14359,親愛主，握我手，使穩步，向前走；
14360,敵雖吼，友雖疏，不驚憂。
14361,經風波，歷黑影，得穩妥，入光明；
14362,握我手，親愛主，向前走！
14363,涉長途，多艱困，親愛主，願你近；
14364,你保守，你扶助，不退後！
14365,聽我求，常引導，加我力，免跌倒；
14366,現今時候已不多，旅世程途快要過；
14367,被提鐘點已在望，我們快要見天王；
14368,但願我們常殷勤，直到救主再降臨。
14369,殷勤服事不冷淡，竭力作工不畏難；
14370,背負十架不自憐，願意為主歷苦艱；
14371,"一直""買賣""到主來，若未回家終不改。"
14372,時時倚靠主大名，殷勤討伐眾惡靈；
14373,雖遇危難仍得勝，未見平安不收陣；
14374,晝夜不斷靠祈禱，在戰場上站得牢。
14375,現今光陰如箭飛，我們盼望快得慰；
14376,願主保守靈、魂、體，完全順服主管理；
14377,但願我們常豫備，直到主來不疲憊。
14378,豫備，雖然受試煉；豫備，雖然無臉面；
14379,豫備，直到我生活不能不向主求說：
14380,求主快來不遲延！求主快來在今天！
14381,"O hope of glory, our Christ will return!"
14382,"We will be raptured, with glory transformed;"
14383,"Glorified with Him, Himself to enjoy,"
14384,In His full likeness we then will be formed.
14385,Glorious hope! Christ will return!
14386,"The old creation will vanish away,"
14387,"No more we'll groan, but have full liberty,"
14388,Enjoy salvation in its utmost way.
14389,"Over the nations with Him we will reign,"
14390,"Priests we will be in His presence to serve,"
14391,Thus His salvation in fullness we'll gain.
14392,"Waiting and watching, we faithfully serve,"
14393,"Running the race, pressing on toward the goal,"
14394,That we the Kingdom's reward might deserve.
14395,榮耀的盼望﹐基督要再臨﹗
14396,我們要被提﹐身體變榮形﹔
14397,享受祂快樂﹐與祂同榮耀﹐
14398,那時纔知道救恩有多高。
14399,榮耀盼望﹐基督再臨﹗
14400,我們要被提﹐身體變榮形﹐
14401,舊造全脫去﹐一切都更新﹔
14402,不再有嘆息﹐歌聲響雲霄﹐
14403,那時纔嘗到救恩的上好。
14404,與祂同作王管理列國民﹐
14405,且要作祭司事奉永活神﹐
14406,那時纔享受至高的救恩。
14407,等候當儆醒﹐事奉當忠心﹐
14408,燈油常豫備﹐前程努力奔﹐
14409,不然怎配得這上好救恩?
14410,"When my blest Lord will come again, I will be saved from all my pain,"
14411,"With all the saints I'll follow Him, O praise the Lord!"
14412,O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
14413,"When I shall see Him face to face, and dwell with Him thro' endless days,"
14414,"I will rejoice and sing His praise, O praise the Lord!"
14415,"When I meet Him before the Throne, my suff'rings then will all be gone,"
14416,"The joy of vict'ry will be won, O praise the Lord!"
14417,"In that day I will testify that nothing with Christ's life can vie,"
14418,"What glorious rapture to the sky, O praise the Lord!"
14419,"May we in our Lord's side e'er hide, be always one and ne'er divide,"
14420,"That His heart may be satisfied, O praise the Lord!"
14421,"O come, our King, O come, dear Lord! Receive us by Thy promised word,"
14422,"And give the victors Thy reward, O praise the Lord!"
14423,當我恩主降臨時候，我要脫盡所有憂愁，
14424,同眾聖徒跟祂而走，哦！讚美主！
14425,哦！讚美主！哦！讚美主！
14426,當我親眼見我救主，與祂永世永遠同住；
14427,我心快樂，我口歡呼，哦！讚美主！
14428,當我見主在那空中，我十字架就不苦重；
14429,何等暢樂與主相逢！哦！讚美主！
14430,當那時候，我要證明無何能勝主的生命；
14431,被提空中何等歡欣！哦！讚美主！
14432,但願我們與主為伴，合而為一不再離散，
14433,好叫耶穌意足心滿，在祂來時！
14434,在祂來時！在祂來時！
14435,好叫耶穌意足心滿！在祂來時！
14436,來罷，我王，願袮就來！接等袮者與袮同在，
14437,使愛袮者得袮賞賚，主阿，快來！
14438,主阿，快來！主阿，快來！
14439,使愛袮者得袮賞賚！主阿，快來！
14440,"Some day the silver cord will break, and I no more as now shall sing;"
14441,"But oh, the joy when I shall wake within the palace of the King!"
14442,"And I shall see Him face to face, and tell the story: saved by grace;"
14443,"And I shall see Him face to face, and tell the story: saved by grace."
14444,"Some day my earthly house will fall, I cannot tell how soon 'twill be;"
14445,"But this I know — my all in all, has now a place in heav'n for me."
14446,"Some day, when fades the golden sun beneath the rosy-tinted west,"
14447,"My blessed Lord shall say, ""Well done!"" and I shall enter into rest."
14448,"Some day; till then I'll watch and wait; my lamp all trimmed and burning bright,"
14449,"That when my Saviour I will greet, my soul to Him may take its flight."
14450,有日銀鍊將要折斷，我就不再如此歌唱；
14451,但我醒來何等喜歡，竟然得以面見我王。
14452,我要看見祂面對面，我要述說救我恩典；
14453,我要看見祂面對面，我要述說救我恩典。
14454,有日地上帳棚傾覆，我也不知是在何年；
14455,但我確知有個住處，為我豫備在主那邊。
14456,有日斜陽就要西沉，地上工作從此完畢；
14457,"得主稱許""忠心僕人，""我要進入永遠安息。"
14458,有日，所以我要準備，把燈剔亮，儆醒守待；
14459,有日主來召我歸回，我魂就要飛投主懷。
14460,"We may not die, but rise and meet the Lord!"
14461,"This blessed hope, God shows us in His Word;"
14462,The Spirit makes it plain to us His own —
14463,"He'll catch us from this world, to His own throne."
14464,"Oh, the bright glory these few words afford!"
14465,"Changed instantly, the twinkling of an eye,"
14466,"And see Thee face to face, our Lord for aye!"
14467,"Some shall not die, but rise and meet the Lord,"
14468,"O precious promise! Faithful, true and good!"
14469,"Although we do not know the day or hour,"
14470,We know that He Himself shall come in power.
14471,"We may not die, then let us more pure be,"
14472,"Cut off each sin, unseen, or that men see,"
14473,"This world is passing, Heaven will quickly come,"
14474,"Then let us day by day, be more like Him!"
14475,"We shall arise, and meet Him in the air!"
14476,Then let us not entangled be down here!
14477,We look for Christ! We do not look for death!
14478,"Our hope at any hour, to leave this earth."
14479,"We shall arise, and to our Lord ascend,"
14480,When His victorious shout the air shall rend!
14481,"O come! Lord Jesus, come! His saints now cry,"
14482,"Come quickly! So, we e'er shall be with Thee."
14483,你要不死，你要被提見主！
14484,這是父神最近所示道路；
14485,聖靈今向我們這樣明說，
14486,要使我們全心轉向寶座。
14487,哦，何榮耀！我要歸回天府！
14488,眨眼之間，我要完全改變！
14489,被提上升，與我主面對面！
14490,這樣應許實在可信可服；
14491,我們雖然不知其時其日，
14492,卻能覺得那個時日已至。
14493,你要不死，因此你當自潔，
14494,一切罪惡，你當完全斷絕；
14495,世界快過，天上榮光快顯，
14496,所以我們度日應當敬虔。
14497,你要被提直到空中見主，
14498,所以你當保守你靈脫俗；
14499,我們現在並非在此等死，
14500,乃是隨時仰望被提離世。
14501,你要不死，你要被提上升！
14502,神的兒女，這是何種得勝！
14503,你靈當說：來吧！主，求袮來！
14504,願袮快來，使我們永同在。
14505,"It may be at morn when the day is awaking,"
14506,"When sun light through darkness and shadow is breaking,"
14507,"That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory,"
14508,To receive from the world His own.
14509,"O Lord Jesus, how long, how long"
14510,"Ere we shout the glad song, Christ returneth! Hallelujah!"
14511,"Hallelujah! Amen, Hallelujah! Amen."
14512,"It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,"
14513,"It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight"
14514,"Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,"
14515,When Jesus receives His own.
14516,"While hosts cry Hosanna, from heaven descending,"
14517,"With glorified saints and the angels attending,"
14518,"With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,"
14519,Will Jesus receive His own.
14520,"O joy! O delight! Should we go without dying,"
14521,"No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying,"
14522,"Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,"
14523,或許在清晨，或在夢醒的黎明，
14524,長夜初過盡，日光正驅散黑影；
14525,那時主耶穌滿披榮耀再降臨，
14526,當主提接祂子民。
14527,哦，主，還需多久！多久！
14528,我們纔能高歌：基督降臨，哈利路亞！
14529,哈利路亞！阿們！哈利路亞！阿們！
14530,或許在正午，或在薄暮的黃昏，
14531,也許在午夜，黑暗深沉的時辰；
14532,主榮耀光芒劃破最深的黑蔭，
14533,"""和散那""聲高，當主自高天降臨，"
14534,得榮眾聖徒與天使一起歡吟；
14535,主榮面射出無限恩典的光明，
14536,何等大欣喜，倘若不死即被提！
14537,再沒有疾病、憂傷、痛苦和哭泣；
14538,與主永同在，共享榮耀於天庭，
14539,The blessed moment has at last arrived: the marriage supper of the Lamb and Bride.
14540,"All overcomers take their place, caught up to heav'n in ceaseless praise!"
14541,"All hidden tears are wiped away, and secret scars no longer stay."
14542,"The righteous acts of saints in grand display: fine linen brightly shines in full array,"
14543,"With precious ointment well applied, the Spirit's master work: the Bride!"
14544,"Rejoicing o'er the marriage feast, I sing. I'm blessed forever! Let His praises ring!"
14545,His grace I tasted once in part: much corn and new wine filled my heart.
14546,"Tho' rough the journey of the cross, yet fatness dropped along my course."
14547,"Now raptured to resplendent courts divine, Immersed in glory naught can e'er outshine,"
14548,Then do I know: my loss and pain has won for me this blessed gain.
14549,"Feasting with Him, His radiance I behold. My face reflects His glory e'er untold."
14550,"In union sweet, my Lord does raise my heart to awe and soul to praise!"
14551,Each painful blow portioned to me now is a precious memory.
14552,The loving gift presented to the Bible is the dear Saviour's scars — there's none beside.
14553,"Henceforward, men with God shall reign through endless days, in new domain!"
14554,有福時刻終於來臨，羔羊婚筵準備完成；
14555,眾優勝者蒙召有分，被提上升喜樂融融；
14556,祕密傷痕無處可尋，背人淚痕也都擦淨。
14557,細麻白衣皎潔晶瑩，馨香四溢聖徒義行；
14558,沒藥乳香膏我全人，聖靈傑作新婦榮形。
14559,盛筵之上歌聲歡騰，永頌羔羊蒙福無窮！
14560,前在塵世稍嘗天恩，五穀新酒樂我心靈；
14561,十架路程雖然難行，下滴脂油潤我途徑。
14562,如今被提天的宮禁，沐於、浸於榮耀無盡；
14563,纔知損失何足介意，換來今日極重福分。
14564,坐祂席上瞻祂慈顏，我臉反映榮耀無限；
14565,我心驚愕，我魂感讚，正當與主甘甜結聯；
14566,當日每一辛酸經驗，今日都成何等記念。
14567,新婦所獲無上禮聘，乃是救主所受傷痕；
14568,從此神人一同君臨，在於新造無窮光陰。
14569,"We shall stand before the King, with the angels we shall sing,"
14570,"By and by, by and by! Walk the bright, the golden shore,"
14571,"Praising Him for ever more, by and by, by and by!"
14572,"We shall stand before the King, with the angels we shall sing:"
14573,"Glory, glory to our King! Hallelujah!"
14574,Hallelujah! We shall stand before the King.
14575,"Ring, ye bells of heaven, ring! We shall stand before the King,"
14576,"By and by, by and by! There our sorrows will be o'er;"
14577,"There His name we will adore, By and by, by and by!"
14578,"Wake, my soul! Thy tribute bring; Thou shalt stand before the King,"
14579,"By and by, by and by! Lay thy trophies at His feet;"
14580,"In His likeness stand complete, By and by, by and by!"
14581,我將站在王面前，與眾天使同頌讚，
14582,再不久！再不久！在那光明精金岸，
14583,頌讚我王到永遠，再不久！再不久！
14584,我將站在王面前，與眾天使同頌讚：
14585,榮耀歸王到永遠！哈利路亞！
14586,哈利路亞！我將站在王面前。
14587,天上聲音要呼喊，我將站在王面前，
14588,再不久！再不久！在彼不再有哀歎，
14589,在彼盡都是頌讚，再不久！再不久！
14590,儆醒，我魂，免怠慢，不久要到王面前，
14591,再不久！再不久！將你珍寶向王獻，
14592,你必得著祂稱讚，再不久！再不久！
14593,主耶穌，我正等待，被提到袮面前；
14594,除了袮的快再來，無別如此甘甜。
14595,我今盼望你降臨，我知道袮已近；
14596,我覺得袮的親近，已經包圍我心。
14597,在我全人最深處。我已聽見你話；
14598,感謝袮，因袮清楚語我以袮計劃。
14599,袮的再臨何等近！袮的顯現已快！
14600,恩典餘日何等緊！仇敵就要敗壞！
14601,求袮斬斷眾籐蔓，使我完全自由；
14602,使我順服不遲慢，緊緊跟隨袮走。
14603,"我願放下""合理事，""免得我心受拘；"
14604,免得當袮再來時，我不能自由去。
14605,時刻等候並儆醒，這是我的心意；
14606,願我完全隨從靈，免得錯過被提。
14607,免得因我未豫備，因我打盹睡覺，
14608,袮就以為我不配，留我在地受熬。
14609,我的心哪，這真是極莊嚴的儆戒；
14610,因此，你所愛的事，應當完全脫解。
14611,應當完全戀慕主，完全想念天家；
14612,無論何時主招呼，能將一切撇下。
14613,雖然有時爭戰猛，多有撒但折磨；
14614,但是不久要高升，所以還怕甚麼！
14615,現今黑暗雖加增，救贖日子也近，
14616,所以你可昂首等，不久主必降臨。
14617,願我所愛惟有主，願我所想惟主；
14618,拒絕世界的賄賂，心今就在天府。
14619,地上束縛已經鬆，我主，求袮就來；
14620,我心盼望到天中，看見我主我愛！
14621,主，當我們被提上升，心要充滿喜樂得勝，
14622,並要何等驚愕！
14623,看見袮面，聽見袮聲，因袮完全的愛歡騰，
14624,袮的榮耀同得。
14625,當那偉大日子、時辰忽然降臨，
14626,宇宙將要充滿何等喜樂歡欣；
14627,救主臉面射出不可逼視光明，
14628,聖徒處處發出如雷得勝呼聲。
14629,哦，這偉大日子！哦，這榮耀俄頃，
14630,罪權消失，死除盡，撒但被毀，陰府傾；
14631,萬有震驚，我歡騰，和散那頌永無盡！
14632,哈利路亞！哈利路亞！哈利路亞！阿們！
14633,流蕩、冷落聖徒，相愛難解難分；
14634,再無墮落表現、肉體力量侵凌，
14635,內外無玷、無垢，顯袮聖潔榮形。
14636,所有今世憂慮，即將消蹤失影；
14637,迷糊淚眼今日大放異彩光明，
14638,無邊無窮喜樂在於無終時境。
14639,榮耀人子要成我們永遠中心；
14640,萬民都要唱出最甜最美聲音，
14641,直到日頭月亮不再升沉虧盈。
14642,滿山遍野迴應天上萬號響聲；
14643,眾聖妝飾整齊，終於被接上升，
14644,諸天爆發采聲，同迎新婦歸寧。
14645,"This world is not my home I'm just a passing thru,"
14646,My treasures are laid up some where beyond the blue;
14647,"The angels beckon me from heaven's open door,"
14648,And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
14649,"O Lord, you know I have no friend like you,"
14650,"If heaven's not my home, Then Lord, what will I do?"
14651,"They're all expecting me, and that's one thing I know,"
14652,My Saviour pardoned me and now I onward go;
14653,"I know He'll take me thru tho' I am weak and poor,"
14654,"I have a loving Father up in glory land,"
14655,I don't expect to stop until I hold His hand;
14656,"He's waiting now for me in heaven's open door,"
14657,"Just up in gloryland we'll live eternally,"
14658,"The saints on ev'ry hand are shouting victory,"
14659,"Their songs of sweetest praise drift back form heaven's shore,"
14660,這世界非我家，我不過是客旅，
14661,我所珍愛財寶，遠藏高天深處；
14662,天門為我大開，天使為我來迎，
14663,我何能再貪愛這世界為我家。
14664,哦，主，祢知我無良友像祢，
14665,天堂若非我家，主阿，我將何依？
14666,我心確知深信，天家正等我歸，
14667,救主既赦我罪，我就望天直奔；
14668,雖我貧窮軟弱，一路祂正引領，
14669,我心所愛救主，早已歸回天家，
14670,我心不能再等，急欲相晤美地；
14671,因祂何等期待，速速帶我歸回，
14672,當我回家之日，會晤各方眾聖，
14673,同心竭力呼喊，這個偉大得勝；
14674,讚美聲音何甜，回響天家四野，
14675,"Oh, think of the home over there, by the side of the river of light,"
14676,"Where the saints, all immortal and fair, are robed in their garments of white."
14677,"Over there, over there, oh, think of the home over there;"
14678,"Over there, over there, over there; oh, think of the home over there;"
14679,"Oh, think of the friends over there, who before us the journey have trod;"
14680,"Of the songs that they breathe on the air, in their home on the palace of God."
14681,My Saviour is now over there; there my kindred an friends are at rest
14682,"Then away from my sorrow and care, let me fly to the land of the blest."
14683,"I'll soon be at home over there, for the end of my journey I see."
14684,Many dear to my heart over there are watching and waiting for me.
14685,我想我家鄉在那邊，在裏面充滿了光燦爛；
14686,在那邊無痛苦，無辛酸，一切又喜樂又平安。
14687,在那邊，在那邊，我想我家鄉在那邊；
14688,在那邊，在那邊，在那邊，我想我家鄉在那邊。
14689,我想神羔羊在那邊，我羨慕能與祂面對面；
14690,祂帶領我來到活水泉，使我享安息永新鮮。
14691,我想我天父在那邊，我盼望能生活祂面前；
14692,祂安慰必擦乾我淚眼，使我享快樂永甘甜。
14693,我想眾聖徒在那邊，許多人都是我所記念；
14694,我祈求與他們再會面，一同歌頌神大恩典。
14695,"I'm but a stranger here, heav'n is my home;"
14696,"Only a sojourner, heav'n is my home."
14697,"Danger and sorrow stand, round me on ev'ry hand,"
14698,"Heav'n is my fatherland, heav'n is my home."
14699,"What though the tempests rage, heav'n is my home;"
14700,"Short is my pilgrim age, heav'n is my home;"
14701,And time's wild wintry blast soon will be over past;
14702,"I shall reach home at last, heav'n is my home."
14703,"Therefore I'll murmur not, heav'n is my home;"
14704,"What'er my earthly lot, heav'n is my home;"
14705,For I shall surely stand there at my Lord's right hand
14706,"Earth is a desert drear, heav'n is my home;"
14707,"I shall be glorified, heav'n is my home;"
14708,"There are the good and blest, those I loved most and best,"
14709,And there I too shall rest; heav'n is my home.
14710,我在異鄉作客，天是我家，
14711,途經可畏曠野，天是我家；
14712,憂愁、危險充斥，時刻環繞身側，
14713,我本來自天鄉，天是我家。
14714,試探風浪洶湧，天是我家，
14715,旅客生涯不長，天是我家；
14716,時間如風飛逝，轉眼一切消失，
14717,至終我將歸家，天是我家。
14718,為此再無怨聲，天是我家，
14719,無懼世慮纏身，天是我家；
14720,因我必將站立，救主寶座前面，
14721,今世原是曠野，天是我家，
14722,我將榮耀返回，天是我家；
14723,得見眾優勝者，素為我所羨愛，
14724,永同安息彼岸，天是我家。
14725,"Shall we gather at the river, where bright angel feet have trod;"
14726,With its crystal tide forever flowing by the throne of God?
14727,"Yes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, the beautiful river,"
14728,Gather with the saints at the river that flows by the throne of God.
14729,"On the bosom of the river, where the Saviour-King we own,"
14730,"We shall meet, and sorrow never, 'neath the glory of the throne."
14731,"Ere we reach the shining river, lay we ev'ry burden down;"
14732,"Grace our spirits will deliver, and provide a robe and crown."
14733,"Soon we'll reach the shining river, soon our pilgrimage will cease;"
14734,Soon our happy hearts will quiver with the melody of peace.
14735,我們將要聚集河邊，行走眾天使中間；
14736,那裏水流透亮清鮮，暢流自神寶座前。
14737,我們必要聚集河邊，何等美麗又美麗的河邊；
14738,與聚聖同聚集河邊-暢流自神寶座前。
14739,水晶河面明亮可鑑，如鏡反映主榮臉；
14740,不再分離，永遠相聯，聖徒頌讚永無間。
14741,在這美麗水晶河邊，平安無浪能飛濺；
14742,我們俯伏敬拜神前，歡樂直至無窮年。
14743,我們快要聚集河邊，旅程快要到終點；
14744,我們快要見主榮面，永遠歡唱祂恩典。
14745,"How enchanting and sweet the thought,"
14746,O what glory is drawing near;
14747,"And thro' each day, I'm closer home,"
14748,Closer to heav'n my Father's home.
14749,"Yes, closer to my home, my heav'nly home, sweet home."
14750,I will ever behold His face; I will ever stand by His side;
14751,"I will ever sing of His grace. Passing this day,"
14752,"I'm closer home, one step closer to my home."
14753,Grief is mingled with pain this day;
14754,Soon I'll cast all my loads away.
14755,But your nearness dispells my fears;
14756,Another day! I'm closer home.
14757,Short is my life in constant trials;
14758,Foes surround me in raging plots.
14759,He consoles me in vales of tears;
14760,"Above this earth, my home I see."
14761,Sigh no more — O weary souls!
14762,Naught can impede — your home is nigh.
14763,"My heart cries out to you, my Lord,"
14764,"""If you must tarry, take me home."""
14765,"No more envy nor bitter strife,"
14766,"No more death, there — time, space entwined,"
14767,What sweet union and joyful praise!
14768,Joint-heirs with Christ thro' endless days.
14769,何等甘甜迷人思想，
14770,又是何等榮耀臨近；
14771,每過一日，更近我家，
14772,更近一步，更近天境。
14773,更近天上美家，哦，是更近我家！
14774,我要永遠瞻祂慈顏，我要永遠傍祂身邊，
14775,我要永遠唱祂恩典；度過今日，
14776,更近一步，更近我父美家。
14777,今天在此憂苦交加，
14778,渴望將我重擔卸下；
14779,有你親近，我無懼怕，
14780,又過一日，更近我家。
14781,生平何短，試煉重重，
14782,仇敵暗中四面環攻；
14783,流淚谷中，主慰我衷，
14784,遙見天家，塵影將終。
14785,疲倦的人，莫再吁歎，
14786,家已在望，再無阻攔；
14787,哦，主，我心向你呼喊：
14788,"""你若遲來，讓我早返。"""
14789,在彼再無尖刻忌猜，
14790,死亡毀滅，時空聯結；
14791,交通何甜，歌聲何歡，
14792,光明之中，同承基業。
14793,"The sands of time are sinking, the dawn of heaven breaks;"
14794,"The summer morn I've sighed for, the fair, sweet morn awakes."
14795,"Dark, dark hath been the midnight, but dayspring is at hand,"
14796,"And glory, glory dwelleth in Immanuel's land."
14797,"O Christ! He is the fountain, the deep, sweet well of love!"
14798,"The streams on earth I've tasted, more deep I'll drink above;"
14799,"There, to an ocean fullness, His mercy doth expand,"
14800,"With mercy and with judgment my web of time He wove,"
14801,And aye the dews of sorrow were lustred with His love;
14802,"I'll bless the hand that guided, I'll bless the heart that plann'd"
14803,When throned where glory dwelleth in Immanuel's land.
14804,"Oh, I am my Beloved's and my Beloved's mine!"
14805,"He brings a poor vile sinner into His ""house of wine."""
14806,"I stand upon His merit — I know no other stand,"
14807,Not e'en where glory dwelleth in Immanuel's land.
14808,"The bride eyes not her garment, but her dear Bridegroom's face;"
14809,"I will not gaze at glory, but on my King of grace."
14810,"Not at the crown He giveth, but on His pierced hand,"
14811,The Lamb is all the glory of Immanuel's land.
14812,玉漏沙殘時將盡﹐天國即將破曉﹔
14813,所慕晨曦即降臨﹐甘甜加上奇妙。
14814,雖經黑暗四圍繞﹐晨光今已四照﹔
14815,榮耀榮耀今充滿以馬內利之境。
14816,哦﹐基督祢是泉源﹐源深甘愛充滿﹔
14817,既淺嘗此泉於地﹐定必暢飲於天。
14818,那裏主愛直擴展﹐猶如海洋湧溢﹔
14819,祂以憐憫和審判﹐織成我的年代﹔
14820,我的憂傷的淚斑﹐也帶愛的光彩。
14821,領我手段何巧妙﹐祂計劃何純正﹔
14822,哦﹐我是屬我良人﹐我良人也屬我﹔
14823,祂帶我這卑賤身﹐進入祂的快樂。
14824,那時﹐我無他靠山﹐只靠救主功勞﹔
14825,前來榮耀所充滿以馬內利之境。
14826,新婦不看她衣裳﹐只看所愛新郎﹔
14827,我也不看我榮耀﹐只是瞻仰我王。
14828,不見祂賜的冠冕﹐只看祂手創傷﹔
14829,羔羊榮耀今充滿以馬內利之境。
14830,更美地，更美地，由信我已得著；
14831,我尋求長安息，榮耀在前領率。
14832,我去風波不生之處，我去沒有眼淚之谷，
14833,沒有傷心、痛楚；我今要去朝見，
14834,朝見我救主。
14835,你儀仗，你儀仗，你迷人的推薦；
14836,你誘人的歡暢，空排在我面前。
14837,我已聽見更甜故事，我已看見更真價值，
14838,得著更美衣裳；我已得著救主，
14839,救主和天堂。
14840,我幕幔，我幕幔，支在野地沙土；
14841,我不能稍轉彎，去流浪人之路。
14842,或者受惑要去尋覓甚麼虛榮，甚麼實利；
14843,或者我就安息，在於耶穌，耶穌
14844,無枕首之地。
14845,有榮耀，有榮耀，正在前面呼召；
14846,我在此不閒聊，不能在此耽誤。
14847,前面就是永遠安息，就是希奇可喜目的；
14848,前面就是天都，前面就是榮耀，
14849,榮耀是耶穌。
14850,我心充滿喜樂，天是我家；
14851,我口不住唱歌，天是我家；
14852,多人不能領會-我得甚麼恩惠
14853,能以如此欣慰！天是我家。
14854,"Who, who are these beside the chilly wave,"
14855,"Just on the borders of the silent grave,"
14856,"Shouting Jesus' pow'r to save,"
14857,"""Washed in the blood of the Lamb""?"
14858,"Sweeping thro' the gates of the New Jerusalem,"
14859,"""Washed in the blood of the Lamb."""
14860,"These, these are they who, in their youthful days,"
14861,"Found Jesus early, And in wisdom's ways,"
14862,"Proved the fullness of His grace,"
14863,"These, these are they who, in affliction's woes,"
14864,"Ever have found in Jesus calm repose,"
14865,"Such as from a pure heart flows,"
14866,"These, these are they who, in the conflict dire,"
14867,Boldly have stood amid the hottest fire;
14868,"Jesus now says, ""Come up higher!"""
14869,"Safe, safe upon the ever-shining shore,"
14870,"Sin, pain, and death, and sorrow, all are o'er;"
14871,"Happy now and evermore,"
14872,這些人是誰？安渡約但波，
14873,死亡的拘禁亦已被衝破；
14874,歡聚彼岸唱新歌，
14875,因有羔羊血洗淨。
14876,長驅直進新耶路撒冷光明境，
14877,因有羔羊血洗淨；
14878,這些人乃是自幼篤信主，
14879,捨棄諸福樂，緊隨祂腳步；
14880,罪蒙赦免身得贖，
14881,這些人乃是不顧得與失，
14882,隨地成戲景，到處受藐視；
14883,心中仍能湧美詞，
14884,這些人乃是忠心直到死，
14885,為求主笑容，湯火都不辭；
14886,雖經苦難仍堅持，
14887,這些人乃是世界不配有，
14888,補充主患難，工作先告休；
14889,歡繞主前到永久，
14890,"When the toils of life are over,"
14891,"And we lay our armor down,"
14892,"And we bid farewell to earth with all its cares,"
14893,"We shall meet and greet our loved ones,"
14894,And our Christ we then shall crown
14895,In the new Jerusalem.
14896,"There'll be singing, there'll be shouting,"
14897,"When the saints come marching home,"
14898,"In Jerusalem, in Jerusalem;"
14899,"Waving palms with loud hosannas,"
14900,"As the King shall take His throne,"
14901,"Though the way is sometimes lonely,"
14902,"He will hold me with His hand,"
14903,Through the testings and the trials I must go;
14904,"But I'll trust and gladly follow,"
14905,"For sometime I'll understand,"
14906,"When the last goodbye is spoken,"
14907,"And the tear-stains wiped away,"
14908,"And our eyes shall catch a glimpse of glory fair,"
14909,Then with bounding hearts we'll meet Him
14910,"Who hath washed our sins away,"
14911,When we join the ransomed army
14912,"In the summerland above,"
14913,"And the face of our dear Saviour we behold,"
14914,We will sing and shout forever
14915,"And we'll grow in perfect love,"
14916,當我跑盡應跑道路﹐
14917,打過當打的美仗﹐
14918,離別世界和它一切的痛苦﹐
14919,我就要再見我親人﹐
14920,並向救主大歌唱﹐
14921,在於新耶路撒冷。
14922,正當聖徒大隊回家﹐
14923,有人歡呼﹐有吟詩﹐
14924,新耶路撒冷﹐新耶路撒冷﹔
14925,手拿棕枝﹐唱和散那﹐
14926,正是大君登基時﹐
14927,雖然道路有時難行﹐
14928,使我腿酸手下垂﹐
14929,雖然難免流淚﹐難免心痛疼﹔
14930,但我欣然相信追隨﹐
14931,因我不久要體會﹐
14932,今在異地寄居作客﹐
14933,雖受窘困仍歡暢﹐
14934,因我不久必到更美的天城﹔
14935,親朋雖以世俗為上﹐
14936,但我天天的仰望﹐
14937,乃在新耶路撒冷。
14938,我今鬥拳不是打空﹐
14939,奔跑不是無定向﹐
14940,乃是愛神更深追求神見證﹔
14941,忘記背後﹐努力面前﹐
14942,向著標竿直奔跑﹐
14943,要到新耶路撒冷。
14944,當我最後告別之後﹐
14945,淚痕也都擦乾淨﹐
14946,我心更要跳動﹐我不能再等﹔
14947,我邊吟詩﹐我邊歡呼﹐
14948,我要與主同高興﹐
14949,"Come, we that love the Lord, and let our joys be known;"
14950,"Join in a song with sweet accord, join in a song with sweet accord,"
14951,"And thus surround the throne, and thus surround the throne."
14952,"We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion;"
14953,"We're marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God."
14954,Let those refuse to sing who never knew our God;
14955,"But children of the heav'nly king, but children of the heav'nly king,"
14956,"May speak their joys abroad, may speak their joys abroad."
14957,"The hill of Zion yields a thousand sacred sweets,"
14958,"Before we reach the heav'nly fields, before we reach the heav'nly fields,"
14959,"Or walk the golden streets, or walk the golden streets."
14960,Then let our songs abound and every tear be dry;
14961,"We're marching through Emmanuel's ground, we're marching through Emmanuel's ground,"
14962,"To fairer worlds on high, to fairer worlds on high."
14963,愛主的人都來，將你喜樂敞開；
14964,甘甜唱著主的奇愛，甘甜唱著主的奇愛，
14965,同到寶座前來，同到寶座前來！
14966,向前直往錫安，美麗又美麗的錫安；
14967,眾聖昂首齊奔錫安，直奔神美麗的聖城。
14968,未識主名的人，讓他緘默無聲；
14969,我們屬天君王兒女，我們屬天君王兒女，
14970,應當喜樂歡騰，應當喜樂歡騰。
14971,未入榮耀之城，未履精金之街，
14972,郇山佳果甜美豐盈，郇山佳果甜美豐盈，
14973,豫嘗何等喜悅，豫嘗何等喜悅。
14974,故當高聲歌唱，忘記所有憂傷；
14975,經過以馬內利境界，經過以馬內利境界，
14976,直達更高天鄉，直達更高天鄉。
15033,"Forward! Be our watchword, steps and voices joined!"
15034,"Seek the things before us, not a look behind;"
15035,"Burns the fiery pillar at our army's head,"
15036,"Who shall dream of shrinking, by our Captain led?"
15037,"Forward thro' the desert, Thro' the toil and fight;"
15038,"Canaan lies before us, Zion beams with light."
15039,"Glories upon glories hath our God prepared,"
15040,By the souls that love Him one day to be shared;
15041,Eye hath not beheld them; ear hath never heard;
15042,Nor of these hath uttered thought or speech a word;
15043,"Forward, ever forward, where the heaven is bright;"
15044,"Till the veil be lifted, till our faith be sight."
15045,"Far o'er yon horizon rise the city towers,"
15046,"Where our God abideth; that fair home is ours,"
15047,"Flash the streets with jasper, shine the gates with gold!"
15048,"Flows the gladd'ning river, shedding joys untold;"
15049,"Thither, onward thither, in the Spirit's might,"
15050,"Pilgrims, to your country, forward into light."
15051,前去！我們口號！同聲並同步；
15052,向著標竿直跑，永不回頭顧。
15053,隊前有柱如火，照明我的面；
15054,耶和華在領率，誰敢想不前？
15055,前去！經過曠野，痛苦和試探；
15056,約但在此可越，明處是錫安。
15057,榮耀又加榮耀，我神已豫備；
15058,凡愛神者必要有日同在內：
15059,眼睛未曾看見，耳朵未曾聞，
15060,榮耀達到極點，思想未曾問。
15061,前去！一直前進！直到光明天，
15062,直到幔子不禁，信心變眼見。
15063,遠在前面天涯，有城正昂聳；
15064,那是我們的家，神住的靈宮：
15065,黃金街中四射，寶石牆上閃，
15066,使人喜樂的河流出喜樂滿。
15067,向彼，前去，向彼，靠聖靈能力；
15068,旅客前去樂地，前去樂無極。
15069,"When all my labors and trials are o'er,"
15070,"And I am safe on that beautiful shore,"
15071,Just to be near the dear Lord I adore
15072,Will thro' the ages be glory for me.
15073,"O that will be glory for me,"
15074,"Glory for me, glory for me;"
15075,"When by His grace I shall look on His face,"
15076,"That will be glory, be glory for me."
15077,"When by the gift of His infinite grace,"
15078,"I am accorded in heaven a place,"
15079,Just to be there and to look on His face
15080,Will through the ages be glory for me.
15081,Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
15082,Joy like a river around me will flow;
15083,"Yet, just a smile form my Saviour, I know,"
15084,當我歇下我工作與試煉，
15085,當我安抵美麗河岸對面，
15086,只要我能靠近愛主身邊，
15087,這就永遠成為我的榮耀。
15088,哦，這就是我的榮耀，
15089,我的榮耀，我的榮耀；
15090,靠祂恩典我得見祂榮面，
15091,這就是榮耀，是我的榮耀。
15092,當我蒙祂無限恩典賜予，
15093,得以在天上同主永安居，
15094,只要能在那裏與主相遇，
15095,當我會見曾久別的親友，
15096,喜樂如江河必繞我湧流，
15097,只要救主笑臉向我一露，
15098,"There's a land that is fairer than day,"
15099,"And by faith we can see it afar,"
15100,"For the Father waits over the way,"
15101,To prepare us a dwelling place there.
15102,"In the sweet by-and-by,"
15103,We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
15104,We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
15105,We shall sing on that beautiful shore
15106,"The melodious songs of the blest,"
15107,"And our spirits shall sorrow no more,"
15108,Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.
15109,To our bountiful Father above
15110,"We will offer our tribute of praise,"
15111,"For the glorious gift of His love,"
15112,And the blessings that hallow our days.
15113,有一地比正午更光明﹐
15114,路遙遙我因信常望見﹐
15115,我天父久已在那邊等﹐
15116,主為我備居所於裏面。
15117,再不久﹐再不久﹐
15118,將會晤眾聖徒於美地﹔
15119,將會晤眾聖徒於美地。
15120,到美地﹐同唱詩﹐同讚頌﹐
15121,眾聖徒心喜樂何久長﹔
15122,得安息﹐享永生﹐常交通﹐
15123,無懼怕﹐無憂愁﹐無悲傷。
15124,再不久﹐同聚集來唱詩﹐
15125,同讚頌我聖父奇妙愛﹔
15126,賜獨子來世界受苦死﹐
15127,使罪人能得救至萬代。
15128,哦，主，撒冷是祢所建設，來賜給世上所有蒙恩的罪人；
15129,一切蒙血救贖，洗得潔淨者，祢都賜給權柄可入她的門。
15130,光是她榮耀已足使我羨慕，何況我主祢是住在她中間；
15131,怎不叫我被吸引注目遠處，就是不見天時，也在想著天。
15132,哦，主，當我每想到撒冷，我就切切想要看見祢的容顏；
15133,我心盼望我能早日被提升，好使我能早日倚傍祢身邊。
15134,我心真羨慕能早日到新地，能同所有愛祢的人來愛祢；
15135,時常歌頌祢的愛無邊無極，時常記念祢愛捨己的蹤跡。
15136,哦，主，我所歡喜和羨慕，不是紅石綠寶，也非碧玉精金；
15137,我所想念乃是祢，愛我的主！祢是何等可愛，何等傾我心！
15138,我求祢早日成全我的心願，提接我到祢前，不再有別離；
15139,好叫我與祢同住直到永遠，常能看見祢，也常能聽見祢。
15140,天堂是愛，是光，又是詩，因為有祢在內作中心，並獎賞；
15141,因為有祢自己和祢的丰姿，纔使天堂對我能成為天堂！
15142,因為有了祢，萬物纔得更新，歎息纔成過去，眼淚纔會乾，
15143,我心纔會滿了安息與歡欣，主阿，為何祢不早日降郇山？
15144,"He looked for a city and lived in a tent,"
15145,A pilgrim to glory right onward he went;
15146,"God's promise his solace, so royal his birth,"
15147,No wonder he sought not the glories of earth.
15148,"Home! Home! Home, sweet home!"
15149,A welcome from Jesus awaits us at home.
15150,"He looked for a city his God should prepare,"
15151,No mansion on earth could he covet or share.
15152,For had not God told him that royal bode
15153,Awaited His pilgrims on ending the road.
15154,He looked for a city; if sometimes he sighed
15155,"To be trudging the road, all earth's glory denied,"
15156,"The thought of that city changed sighing to song,"
15157,"For the road might be rough, but it could not be long."
15158,"He looked for a city; his goal, Lord, we share;"
15159,And know that bright city which Thou dost prepare
15160,"Is ever our portion, since willing to be"
15161,"Just pilgrims with Jesus, our roof a tent tree."
15162,他等候一座城，卻住在帳棚，
15163,這天城的旅客，一直奔前程；
15164,他有美好證據，前途實堪誇，
15165,難怪他不尋求地上的榮華。
15166,家！家！甘美家！
15167,主耶穌在家等，要歡迎我們！
15168,他等候一座城，他神的住處，
15169,他沒有，也不求地上的房屋；
15170,因神豈非說過，屬天的家鄉，
15171,是那不離正道旅客所安享。
15172,他等候一座城，雖然有時因
15173,跋涉苦，喪失多，有歎息聲音；
15174,但一想到那城，就引聲歌唱，
15175,因為路雖崎嶇，必定不會長。
15176,他等候一座城，我們今亦然：
15177,望能在袮城中，同袮永為伴，
15178,享受袮的豫備；因此也願意
15179,以帳棚為寄廬，同袮客此地。
15180,Prayer is the incense of a holy heart
15181,"Rising to God from bruised and broken things,"
15182,When kindled by the Spirit's burning breath
15183,And upward borne by faith's ascending wings.
15184,"Prayer is the perfume of the plants of grace,"
15185,"The flow'rs of patience, faith, and suff'ring love;"
15186,"Treasured in ""vials full of odors sweet,"""
15187,God breathes their fragrance in His courts above.
15188,Prayer is th' ascending vapor which supplies
15189,"The showers of blessing, and the stream that flows"
15190,"Through earth's dry places, till on every side"
15191,"""The wilderness shall blossom as the rose."""
15192,"Prayer is the golden pipes the Spirit fills,"
15193,"Which feed the lamps of God with oil divine,"
15194,"And, as with one accord we wait and pray,"
15195,"The Spirit fills, the lamps with brightness shine."
15196,"Prayer is the mightiest force of earth and heav'n,"
15197,Prayer is the very dynamite of God;
15198,"It moves the hand that all things moves, and turns"
15199,The living wheels that sweep through earth abroad.
15200,"Teach us to pray! Move on our hearts, O Lord,"
15201,Till Thine own passions all our being move!
15202,"Teach us! Pray in us, till our prayer shall be"
15203,Christ in us praying to the Christ above!
15204,禱告乃是靈中所燒聖香﹐
15205,經過破碎之人向神獻上﹔
15206,乃是由焚燒之靈所點燃﹐
15207,並藉信心之翼升到神前。
15208,禱告乃是恩典芳香所播﹐
15209,信心、愛心、苦難澆灌花朵﹔
15210,藏在滿了香氣玉瓶裏面﹐
15211,給神吸入﹐欣賞其味之甜。
15212,禱告乃是上升含水之氣﹐
15213,供給甘雨﹐並使河流不息﹔
15214,灌溉乾地﹐直到地的四方﹐
15215,所有沙漠都像玫瑰開放。
15216,禱告乃是聖靈所滿金管﹐
15217,用神的油供給神的燈盞﹔
15218,正當我們同心等候、禱告﹐
15219,靈就充滿﹐燈就發光照耀。
15220,禱告乃是宇宙最大力量﹐
15221,乃是神的炸藥﹐無何能擋﹔
15222,推動那隻推動一切之手﹐
15223,轉動活輪﹐掠過全地無留。
15224,教我禱告﹗運行在我靈中﹐
15225,直到全人被祢感覺推動﹗
15226,在我裏面禱告﹐直到顯出
15227,我裏基督禱告天上基督。
15263,"'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend，"
15264,"And we gather to Jesus, our Saviour and Friend;"
15265,"If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,"
15266,What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
15267,"Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of prayer;"
15268,"'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Saviour draws near,"
15269,With a tender compassion His children to hear;
15270,"When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,"
15271,"'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried"
15272,To the Saviour who loves them their sorrow confide;
15273,"With a sympathizing heart He removes every care,"
15274,"At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe"
15275,That the blessings we're needing we'll surely receive;
15276,In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;
15277,是有福禱告良辰，我心謙卑俯伏；
15278,我們一同來親近恩友主耶穌。
15279,既憑信心到主前，就享主的眷顧；
15280,困倦如我得膏抹，何等甜美之處。
15281,有福的良辰，有福的良辰，
15282,困倦者得著膏抹，何等甜美之處。
15283,是有福禱告良辰，主來親密相交；
15284,滿帶慈愛與憐憫，傾聽我禱告。
15285,祂命我可將重負在祂腳前卸除，
15286,壓傷如我得膏抹，何等甜美之處。
15287,是有福禱告良辰，愛主親來安撫；
15288,凡被試煉重壓者，可向祂投訴。
15289,惟有祂能表同情，撫慰每一痛楚；
15290,傷痛如我得膏抹，何等甜美之處。
15291,是有福禱告良辰，憑信仰望恩主；
15292,深知所需主供應，恩惠必豐足。
15293,主的應許極穩固，我不動搖躊躇；
15294,缺乏如我得膏抹，何等甜美之處。
15295,"Ev'ry pray'r will find its answer,"
15296,"Ev'ry earnest, trusting plea;"
15297,"Pray, and know that God is faithful,"
15298,Tho' the world unfaithful be!
15299,For the word of God is sure;
15300,"Suns may fade and worlds may vanish,"
15301,But His promise shall endure.
15302,"He has promised, ""Whatsoever"
15303,"Ye shall ask, ye shall receive;"""
15304,"Naught shall fail of blest fulfillment,"
15305,If we steadfastly believe.
15306,Tho' it be in distant years;
15307,"Past our earthly time of testing,"
15308,Past our pleading and our tears.
15309,Let us cling with hope sublime;
15310,"To the promise everlasting,"
15311,Reaching past the bounds of time.
15312,每一禱告都有答應﹐
15313,所以信心要堅定﹔
15314,你只祈求﹐主必垂聽﹐
15315,縱然天地會變更。
15316,因主應許不落空﹔
15317,天地縱然都會變更﹐
15318,但主話語不搖動。
15319,救主曾經如此應許﹕
15320,"""凡是祈求就得著；"""
15321,主的應許不能廢去，
15322,只要相信不疑惑。
15323,每一禱告都有答應，
15324,雖然答應有早晚；
15325,也許經過許多曲徑，
15326,經過長時的試煉。
15327,所以當憑信心祈求，
15328,充滿盼望和感讚；
15329,直等時間到了盡頭，
15330,看見應許得成全。
15355,"What a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!"
15356,What a privilege to carry everything to God in pray'r!
15357,"Oh, what peace we often forfeit, Oh, what needless pain we bear,"
15358,All because we do not carry everything to God in pray'r!
15359,Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?
15360,"We should never be discouraged, take it to the Lord in pray'r."
15361,Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share?
15362,"Jesus knows our every weakness, take it to the Lord in pray'r."
15363,"Are we weak and heavy-laden, cumbered with a load of care?"
15364,"Precious Saviour, still our refuge — take it to the Lord in pray'r."
15365,"Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in pray'r."
15366,In His arms He'll take and shield thee; thou wilt find a solace there.
15367,何等朋友﹐我主耶穌﹗擔我罪孽負我憂﹔
15368,何等權利﹐能將難處到主面前去祈求。
15369,多少平安屢屢喪失﹐多少痛苦無須受﹔
15370,無非我們未將萬事到主面前去祈求。
15371,我們有否苦難、艱辛﹖有否試探和引誘﹖
15372,不能因此失望、灰心﹐應當向主去祈求。
15373,誰能像祂忠實、穩妥﹐背我重擔分我愁﹖
15374,惟祂知我每一軟弱﹐故當向主去祈求。
15375,我們是否疲倦﹐苦楚、思慮、重擔壓心頭﹖
15376,救主仍舊是避難處﹐應當向祂去祈求。
15377,朋友有否賣你、棄你﹖應當向主去祈求﹔
15378,祂的懷抱是你護庇﹐經祂撫慰必無憂。
15395,Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of prayer!
15396,"That calls me from a world of care,"
15397,And bids me at my Father's throne
15398,Make all my wants and wishes known.
15399,"In seasons of distress and grief,"
15400,My soul has often found relief
15401,"And oft escaped the tempter's snare,"
15402,"By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!"
15403,Thy wings shall my petition bear
15404,To Him whose truth and faithfulness
15405,Engage the waiting soul to bless;
15406,"And since He bids me seek His face,"
15407,"Believe His word, and trust His grace,"
15408,"I'll cast on Him my every care,"
15409,"And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!"
15410,May I thy consolation share
15411,"Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,"
15412,I view my home and take my flight.
15413,"This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise"
15414,To seize the everlasting prize;
15415,"And shout, while passing through the air,"
15416,"""Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer."""
15417,禱告之時﹐甘甜之時﹗
15418,使我離開煩惱之事﹔
15419,來到神的座前發表
15420,所有意願﹐所有需要。
15421,當我遇到重壓、憂愁﹐
15422,我靈卻常得著自由﹔
15423,不陷惡者所有佈置﹐
15424,因為有你-禱告之時﹗
15425,如有雙翼載我願辭﹐
15426,到祂寶座向祂求懇﹐
15427,祂是信實﹐祂是全真。
15428,祂既命我尋求祂面﹐
15429,信祂話語﹐靠祂恩典﹔
15430,我要將我重擔卸釋﹐
15431,在於你前-甘甜之時﹗
15432,每次相逢慰我心思﹔
15433,直到我在毗斯迦山﹐
15434,發現我家極目一看﹐
15435,脫下帳棚﹐安靜等候﹐
15436,信心變見﹐盼望成就﹔
15437,臨行我必大聲告辭﹕
15438,平安、平安﹐禱告之時﹗
15466,Unanswered yet? The prayer your lips have pleaded
15467,In agony of heart these many years?
15468,"Does faith begin to fail, is hope departing,"
15469,And think you all in vain those falling tears?
15470,Say not the Father hath not heard your prayer;
15471,"You shall have your desire, sometime, somewhere,"
15472,"You shall have your desire, sometime, somewhere."
15473,"Unanswered yet? Nay, do not say ungranted;"
15474,Perhaps your part is not yet wholly done;
15475,"The work began when first your prayer was uttered,"
15476,And God will finish what He has begun.
15477,If you will keep the incense burning there;
15478,"His glory you shall see, sometime, somewhere,"
15479,"His glory you shall see, sometime, somewhere."
15480,Unanswered yet? Faith cannot be unanswered;
15481,Her feet were firmly planted on the Rock;
15482,"Amid the wildest storm prayer stands undaunted,"
15483,Nor quails before the loudest thunder shock;
15484,"She knows Omnipotence has heard her prayer,"
15485,"And cries, ""It shall be done, sometime, somewhere,"""
15486,"And cries, ""It shall be done, sometime, somewhere. """
15487,尚未蒙允?你衷心禱告祈求﹐
15488,憂傷痛苦多年充滿心頭?
15489,信心是否衰退﹐盼望又破滅﹐
15490,多少眼淚是否盡付東流?
15491,天父並非不垂聽你祈求﹐
15492,到了時候﹐所望必得成就﹐
15493,到了時候﹐所望必得成就。
15494,尚未蒙允?不要說永不蒙允﹔
15495,你的本分是否為主已盡?
15496,當你開始禱告﹐祂已動聖工﹐
15497,神的工作必按時候成功﹔
15498,只要你將心香點得久長﹐
15499,到了時候﹐必見救主榮光﹐
15500,到了時候﹐必見救主榮光。
15501,尚未蒙允?信心終必蒙垂聽﹔
15502,立在磐石兩足穩固堅定﹔
15503,狂風暴雨之中﹐仍勇敢禱告﹐
15504,雷聲雖大﹐也不動搖絲毫﹔
15505,全能真神已垂聽你祈求﹐
15506,我主到了時候﹐必要成就﹐
15507,我主到了時候﹐必要成就。
15564,"Thou, my everlasting portion, more than friend or life to me,"
15565,"All along my pilgrim journey, Saviour, let me walk with Thee."
15566,"Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee;"
15567,"Not for ease or worldly pleasure, not for fame my prayer shall be;"
15568,"Gladly will I toil and suffer, only let me walk with Thee."
15569,"Lead me through the vale of shadows, bear me o'er life's fitful sea;"
15570,"Then the gate of life eternal may I enter, Lord, with Thee."
15571,主是我永遠的福分﹐勝過朋友與生命﹔
15572,在人生孤單旅程中﹐懇求主與我同行。
15573,靠近主﹐靠近主﹐靠近主﹐靠近主﹔
15574,我不求世界的歡樂﹐也不求世界美名﹔
15575,我願受任何的勞苦﹐只求主與我同行。
15576,靠近主﹐靠近主﹐靠近主﹐靠近主﹐
15577,帶領我經黑暗幽谷﹐安然渡苦海危程﹔
15578,當天上永生門大開﹐願與主同進天庭。
15579,"""If with all your hearts ye truly seek me,"

15587,"Heir of salvation, purchase of God!"
15588,"Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood."
15589,"This is my story, this is my song,"
15590,Praising my Saviour all the day long.
15591,"Perfect submission, perfect delight,"
15592,Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
15593,"Angels descending, bring from above"
15594,"Echoes of mercy, whispers of love."
15595,"Perfect submission, all is at rest,"
15596,I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
15597,"Watching and waiting, looking above,"
15598,"Filled with His goodness, lost in His love."
15599,耶穌是我的﹐我有把握﹐
15600,這使我豫嘗榮耀生活！
15601,已蒙血贖回﹐已受恩賜﹐
15602,已由靈重生﹐作神後嗣。
15603,這是我自傳﹐是我詩歌﹐
15604,讚美我救主﹐長日不息！
15605,一完全順服﹐完全甘甜﹐
15606,被提之景象顯在眼前﹔
15607,似乎有聲音從天而來﹐
15608,纏綿說憐憫﹐耳語述愛。
15609,一完全順服﹐所有安息﹐
15610,與主能交通﹐一無祕密﹔

15621,"I have a Friend so precious, so very dear to me,"
15622,"He loves me with such tender love, He loves so faithfully;"
15623,"I could not live apart from Him, I love to feel Him nigh,"
15624,"And so we dwell together, my Lord and I."
15625,"Sometimes I'm faint and weary, He knows that I am weak,"
15626,"And as He bids me lean on Him, His help I gladly seek;"
15627,"He leads me in the paths of light, beneath a sunny sky,"
15628,"And so we walk together, my Lord and I."
15629,"He knows how much I love Him, He knows I love Him well;"
15630,But with what love He loveth me my tongue can never tell;
15631,"It is an everlasting love in ever rich supply,"
15632,"And so we love each other, my Lord and I."
15633,"I tell Him all my sorrows, I tell Him all my joys,"
15634,"I tell Him all that pleases me, I tell Him what annoys;"
15635,"He tells me what I ought to do, He tells me how to try,"
15636,"And so we talk together, my Lord and I."
15637,"He knows how I am longing some weary soul to win,"
15638,And so He bids me go and speak the loving Word for Him;
15639,"He bids me tell His wondrous love, and why He came to die,"
15640,"And so we work together, my Lord and I."
15641,"He tells me of His Kingdom, it is not far away;"
15642,"And oh, His heart is longing to take me there some day."
15643,Immortal bliss is waiting and joys that never die;
15644,"Soon there we'll reign together, my Lord and I."
15645,我有一位好朋友﹐我是非常寶貴﹔
15646,祂是愛我如此溫柔﹐祂愛非常甜美。
15647,我不能活無祂之處﹐我愛祂的提握﹔
15648,所以我們就同住﹐我主與我。
15649,有時我幾乎臥倒﹐祂知我的軟弱﹔
15650,當祂叫我向祂倚靠﹐我樂受祂扶托。
15651,祂帶我走光明途徑﹐日過光明生活﹔
15652,所以我們就同行﹐我主與我。
15653,祂知我愛祂幾多﹐祂知我愛淺深﹔
15654,但祂是用何愛愛我﹐我永不能說清。
15655,乃是一愛永遠不衰﹐越過越像熱火﹔
15656,所以彼此就相愛﹐我主與我。
15657,我告祂以我痛苦﹐告祂以我歡喜﹔
15658,我告祂以我所羨慕﹐告祂以我刺激。
15659,祂告我以所當策勵﹐告我以所當作﹔
15660,我們彼此吐心意﹐我主與我。
15661,祂知我心真羨慕能救一個靈魂﹐
15662,祂就叫我為祂外出﹐去報愛的新聞﹔
15663,祂叫我說祂的奇愛﹐並祂受死經過﹔
15664,我們如此常同在﹐我主與我。
15665,祂告我以祂國度﹐離此並不太遠﹔
15666,祂心切望能夠儘速把我帶到那邊。
15667,無終幸福﹐喜樂在望﹐還有榮耀寶座﹔
15668,不久我們同作王﹐我主與我。
15669,"I have a longing in my heart for Jesus,"
15670,I have a longing in my heart for Him;
15671,"Although I know His presence lingers near me,"
15672,I have a longing just to see His face.
15673,"Longing, longing for Jesus,"
15674,"Just to be near Him, to feel His presence,"
15675,I have a longing in my heart for Him.
15676,"I have a longing just to walk with Jesus,"
15677,"I have a longing just to hold His hand,"
15678,"To know He's there forever near to guide me,"
15679,To know His love will never let me go.
15680,"To you who do not know this man named Jesus,"
15681,You've never lived or found life's greatest joy;
15682,"Oh, won't you now take Him as Lord and Saviour,"
15683,And know the fullness of His matchless love?
15684,我心中饑渴地愛慕著耶穌﹐
15685,我心中饑渴地愛慕著祂﹔
15686,雖然我知道祂常在我身旁﹐
15687,我仍要渴望見著祂的面。
15688,心中渴慕著耶穌﹐
15689,我心中饑渴地愛慕耶穌﹔
15690,但求接近祂﹐常與祂同在﹐
15691,我心中饑渴地愛慕耶穌。
15692,我心中渴望能夠追隨耶穌﹐
15693,我心中渴望祂親手提挈﹔
15694,使我感到祂親自帶領著我﹐
15695,感到祂的愛永遠不離開。
15696,你也許並不知道誰是耶穌﹐
15697,你還沒享受人生的最樂﹔
15698,啊﹐你能否接受祂作你救主﹐
15699,領受祂豐盛無量的恩典﹖
15714,"I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,"
15715,And it told Thy love to me;
15716,But I long to rise in the arms of faith
15717,And be closer drawn to Thee.
15718,"Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,"
15719,To the cross where Thou hast died;
15720,"Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,"
15721,"To Thy precious, bleeding side."
15722,"Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,"
15723,By the pow'r of grace divine;
15724,"Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,"
15725,And my will be lost in Thine.
15726,"Oh, the pure delight of a single hour"
15727,"That before Thy throne I spend,"
15728,"When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,"
15729,I commune as friend with friend!
15730,There are depths of love that I cannot know
15731,Till I cross the narrow sea;
15732,There are heights of joy that I may not reach
15733,Till I rest in peace with Thee.
15734,主﹐我是屬祢﹐我聽祢宣告﹐
15735,知祢愛我的無匹﹔
15736,但我是渴望能因信升高﹐
15737,能以和祢更親密。
15738,吸引我近﹐更近﹐親愛主﹐
15739,直至祢流血身邊﹔
15740,吸引我近﹐更近﹐更近﹐親愛主﹐
15741,直至祢同在中間。
15742,靠著祢恩典﹐求祢分別我﹐
15743,從此專一事奉祢﹔
15744,讓我靈望祢﹐有堅定把握﹐
15745,我志消失祢旨裏。
15746,費時雖不多﹐喜樂已難言﹐
15747,當我座前小逗遛﹔
15748,俯伏祢腳前﹐和祢面對面﹐
15749,交通有如人間友。
15750,愛有其深處﹐我不能通曉﹐
15751,除非有日到那邊﹔
15752,樂有其高處﹐我無法達到﹐
15753,除非安息祢面前。
15754,"O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me, and all things else recede,"
15755,"My heart be daily nearer Thee, from sin be daily freed."
15756,"Each day let Thy supporting might my weakness still embrace,"
15757,"My darkness vanish in Thy light, Thy life my death efface."
15758,"In Thy bright beams which on me fall, fade every evil thought;"
15759,"That I am nothing, Thou art all, I would be daily taught."
15760,"More of Thy glory let me see, thou Holy, Wise, and True."
15761,I would Thy living image be in joy and sorrow too.
15762,"Fill me with gladness from above, hold me by strength divine;"
15763,"Lord, let the glow of Thy great love through all my being shine."
15764,Make this poor self grow less and less; be Thou my life and aim.
15765,"Oh, make me daily through Thy grace more meet to bear Thy name."
15766,哦﹐主﹐求祢長在我心﹐祢外再無他求﹔
15767,使我逐日與祢更親﹐逐日向罪自由。
15768,願祢逐日維持的力﹐仍然顧我軟弱﹔
15769,祢的亮光除我陰翳﹐生命吞我死涸。
15770,當祢榮光照我心頭﹐所有惡念都消﹔
15771,"""我是無有﹐祢是萬有﹐""我願常受此教。"
15772,祢這聖潔、榮耀的主﹐讓我更多瞻仰﹔
15773,無論快樂或是艱苦﹐我願作祢活像。
15774,天上喜樂﹐求祢膏我﹐靈力﹐求祢助我﹔
15775,但願祢的熱切愛火﹐從我全人射過。
15776,可憐的己﹐願其消沈﹐惟祢作我目標﹔
15777,使我逐日藉著祢恩﹐更配與祢相交。
15778,"O Lord, Thy face I am seeking, hide not Thy face from me."
15779,"Let my heart rejoice in Thy presence, let my soul sing praise to Thee."
15780,"Show me Thy glory, I plead, draw me — I'll run after Thee."
15781,"O Lord, Thy face I am seeking, hide not Thy face from me!"
15782,主阿﹐祢面我正尋求﹐不要向我隱藏﹔
15783,我心歡暢於祢同在﹐我魂向祢歌唱。
15784,向我彰顯祢的榮耀﹔引我﹐使我緊隨趨。
15785,主阿﹐祢面我正尋求﹐不要向我隱藏。
15836,"I need Thee ev'ry hour, most gracious Lord;"
15837,No tender voice like Thine can peace afford.
15838,"I need Thee, oh, I need Thee; ev'ry hour I need Thee;"
15839,"Oh, bless me now, my Saviour! I come to Thee."
15840,"I need Thee every hour, stay Thou near by;"
15841,Temptations lose their power when Thou art nigh.
15842,"I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain,"
15843,"Come quickly and abide, or life is vain."
15844,"I need Thee every hour, Teach me Thy will;"
15845,And Thy rich promises in me fulfill.
15846,"I need Thee every hour, Most Holy One;"
15847,"Oh, make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son."
15848,我時刻需要祢﹐親愛的主﹐
15849,祢的聲音有力﹐慰我孤苦。
15850,我需要祢﹐需要祢﹐無時不需要祢﹐
15851,切切求主賜能力﹗我來就祢。
15852,我時刻需要祢﹐與我親近﹔
15853,試探失去能力﹐當祢來臨。
15854,我時刻需要祢﹐或甘或苦﹔
15855,若我與祢遠離﹐時刻虛度。
15856,我時刻需要祢﹐我今懇求﹕
15857,祢所應許福氣﹐向我成就。
15858,我時刻需要祢﹐我神我主﹐
15859,從此祢我合一﹐永遠無阻。
15904,"My spirit longs for Thee within my troubled breast,"
15905,Though I unworthy be of so divine a Guest.
15906,"Of so divine a Guest unworthy though I be,"
15907,"Yet has my heart no rest, unless it comes from Thee."
15908,"Unless it comes from Thee, in vain I look around;"
15909,In all that I can see no rest is to be found.
15910,No rest is to be found but in Thy blessed love
15911,"O let my wish be crowned, and send it from above!"
15912,我靈羨慕要祢﹐在我紛擾胸臆﹔
15913,我實不配來得如此神聖之客。
15914,如此神聖之客﹐我雖不配來得﹔
15915,但我心無安息﹐若非祢將它給。
15916,若非祢將它給﹐我要四顧失依﹔
15917,盡我所能發現﹐安息無處可見。
15918,安息無處可見﹐只有在祢愛間﹔
15919,願我羨慕得足﹐祢從高天傾注。

16022,主耶穌﹐我羨慕活在祢面前﹐
16023,在早晨﹐在晚上﹐只有一世間﹔
16024,不讓我心快樂﹐若我在愛慕、
16025,在感覺或思想無祢的事物。
16026,每一刻﹐每一天﹐不論何痛苦﹐
16027,當世上正沒有甚麼可鼓舞﹐
16028,當歎息正不禁﹐眼淚流滴滴﹐
16029,主﹐擦乾我眼淚﹐平靜我歎息。
16030,我每次如夢想人生的善美﹐
16031,親愛主﹐我求祢﹐必須也在內！
16032,不讓我離開祢去尋求快樂﹐
16033,不讓我憑自己去單獨選擇！
16034,當每夜萬籟靜﹐孤單自處時﹐
16035,主耶穌﹐我求祢﹐仍與我同止﹔
16036,當每晨未破曉﹐我仍蒙昧中﹐
16037,求祢來低聲喚﹐將我耳開通。
16038,當每次我虔讀祢聖潔話語﹐
16039,求祢用祢榮耀照亮每一句﹔
16040,讓我能明看見﹕這寶貴救主﹐
16041,和祂的大救恩﹐無一不我屬。
16042,當我正無倚靠﹐跪到祢座前﹐
16043,求垂聽我禱告﹐賜夠用恩典﹔
16044,有時候因有錯﹐禱告祢不聽﹐
16045,別收回祢同在﹐使我感不寧。
16046,當每次我想到屬天的福氣﹐
16047,讓我心切羨慕早日會見祢﹔
16048,我在此所希望只有祢再來﹐
16049,我在彼所快樂只有祢同在。
16050,主﹐求祢教訓我活在祢面前﹐
16051,親愛主﹗寶貝主﹗我輕視我事物﹔
16052,有誰像祢如此美麗﹐如此甘甜﹐如此柔細﹖
16053,祢是人中無比﹐誰能與祢相匹﹗
16054,親愛主﹗寶貝主﹗我聽見祢招呼﹔
16055,祢的聲音入我心內﹐我就脫離所有纏累﹐
16056,驕傲都歸虛無﹐追求都變庸俗。
16057,親愛主﹗寶貝主﹗我怎能再頑固﹖
16058,我將剛硬投祢腳旁﹐領首詩歌回家去唱﹔
16059,歡喜作祢奴僕﹐歡喜向祢屈服。
16060,親愛主﹗寶貝主﹗我揀選祢道路﹕
16061,一面順服﹐一面流淚﹐但我不肯改變地位﹔
16062,我要討祢喜悅﹐羨慕愛的暴虐。
16063,親愛主﹗寶貝主﹗自從祢去天府﹐
16064,我臉好像不能再笑﹐我天好像不能再曉﹔
16065,我只想祢回來﹐我只想祢同在。
16066,親愛主﹗寶貝主﹗讓我來向祢訴﹕
16067,祢是我所朝夕思慕﹐只有祢能使我滿足﹔
16068,得祢甚麼都有﹐祢外無所要求。
16069,親愛主﹗寶貝主﹗我奉獻我事物﹔
16070,有誰像祢如此美麗﹐如此甘甜﹐如此柔細﹖

16167,撇下罪中樂、驕傲、炫誇﹐
16168,惟要得救主﹐誇主十字架﹐
16169,惟要得救主﹐誇主十字架。
16170,親近﹐更親近﹐終生親近﹐
16171,直到榮耀裏﹐我錨已拋穩﹔
16172,親近﹐更親近﹐永遠親近﹐
16173,無論到何時﹐與主還相親﹐
16174,無論到何時﹐與主還相親。
16233,I love to tell the story of unseen things above;
16234,"Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love."
16235,I love to tell the story because I know 'tis true;
16236,It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.
16237,"I love to tell the story, 'twill be my theme in glory,"
16238,"To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love."
16239,"I love to tell the story, more wonderful it seems"
16240,Than all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams.
16241,"I love to tell the story, it did so much for me;"
16242,And that is just the reason I tell it now to thee.
16243,"I love to tell the story, 'tis pleasant to repeat"
16244,"What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet."
16245,"I love to tell the story, for some have never heard"
16246,The message of salvation from God's own Holy Word.
16247,"I love to tell the story, for those who know it best"
16248,Seemed hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest.
16249,"And when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song,"
16250,"'Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long."
16251,我愛傳講主福音﹐傳講天上妙事﹐
16252,傳講耶穌愛罪人﹐傳講祂為人死﹔
16253,我愛傳講主福音﹐福音是神大能﹐
16254,能救罪人免沉淪﹐能叫死人得生。

16259,我愛傳講主福音﹐福音益我何多﹔
16260,使我得到一新心﹐使我得進神國。
16261,我愛傳講主福音﹐因人多未聽見﹐
16262,神是如何的慈仁﹐如何充滿愛憐﹔
16263,我愛傳講主福音﹐因那常聽之人﹐
16264,仍是饑渴要聽聞﹐像那未聽之人。
16265,我愛傳講主福音﹐越傳越覺甘甜﹔
16266,每逢對人來講論﹐愈講愈覺新鮮。
16267,等我進到榮耀境﹐所唱之歌必新﹔
16268,雖新﹐仍是這一生所愛老舊福音。
16285,"I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory,"
16286,"A dear, loving Saviour, tho' earth-friends be few;"
16287,"And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me,"
16288,"But O, that my Saviour were your Saviour too!"
16289,"For you I am praying, for you I am praying,"
16290,"For you I am praying, I'm praying for you."
16291,I have a Father; to me He has given
16292,"A hope for eternity, blessed and true;"
16293,"And soon He will call me to meet Him in Heaven,"
16294,"But O, that He'd let me bring you with me too!"
16295,"I have a joy, rolling as the sea billows,"
16296,Since Jesus my Saviour took my sins away;
16297,And now He lives in me — what joy divine o'erflows!
16298,"But O, that He'd give you this same joy today."
16299,"I have a peace; it is calm as a river,"
16300,A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
16301,"My Saviour alone is its author and giver,"
16302,"And O, could I know it was given for you!"
16303,"When He has found you, tell others the story,"
16304,"That my loving Saviour is your Saviour, too;"
16305,"Then pray that your Saviour may bring them to glory,"
16306,And prayer will be answered — 'twas answered for you!
16307,我有一救主﹐在天為我祈求﹐

16317,我有一喜樂﹐滾滾猶如海波﹐
16318,因為我救主已擔去我罪惡﹐
16319,並且祂現今還在我裏面活著﹐
16320,哦﹐願我救主也賜你這喜樂﹗
16321,我有一平安﹐靜如湖水一般﹐
16322,奇妙的平安﹐世上友未知曉﹔
16323,惟有主耶穌﹐祂是這平安根源﹐
16324,哦﹐願這平安﹐你也能親嘗到﹗
16325,等主救了你﹐請也告訴別人﹐
16326,我主曾如何也把你來拯救﹔
16327,並且要祈求﹐求你主也救他們﹐
16328,主聽我祈求﹐也必聽你祈求﹗
16329,"Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,"
16330,Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;
16331,"Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,"
16332,"We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves."
16333,"Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,"
16334,"We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves;"
16335,"Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,"
16336,Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;
16337,"By and by, the harvest and the labor ended,"
16338,"Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,"
16339,Tho' the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
16340,"When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome,"
16341,早晨我們播種﹐晌午我們播種﹐
16342,傍晚我們播種﹐播出神慈愛﹔
16343,等候成熟日子﹐等候收割點鐘﹐
16344,我們喜樂滿懷﹐禾捆帶回來。
16345,禾捆帶回來﹐禾捆帶回來﹐
16346,我們喜樂滿懷﹐禾捆帶回來﹔
16347,炎日我們播種﹐陰天我們播種﹐
16348,不怕朔風怒號﹐不怕烏雲蓋﹔
16349,不久莊稼成熟﹐不久一切完工﹐
16350,起來﹐前去播種﹐為主流淚播種﹐
16351,雖然時遭損失﹐雖然當忍耐﹔
16352,哭泣就會過去﹐歡迎就在路終﹐
16353,"When I come to the end of myself, oh Lord, You're there."
16354,"When I come to the end of strength, oh Lord, You're there."
16355,"When I come to the end of all that I have,"
16356,"And I fall on my face before you,"
16357,"Lord, I'll always know that You will meet me there."
16358,當我來到我盡頭時候，袮就在那裏；
16359,當我力量到盡頭時候，袮就在那裏。
16360,當我所有一切到盡頭時候，
16361,主阿，我就俯伏在袮前；
16362,我知在我盡頭，袮要遇見我。

16364,Praise Him in the firmament of His pow'r.
16365,Praise Him for His mighty acts;
16366,Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.
16367,Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the psaltery and harp.
16368,Praise Him with the timbrel and dance;
16369,Praise Him with stringed instruments and organs.
16370,Praise Him upon the loud cymbals;
16371,Praise Him upon the high sounding cymbals.
16372,Let ev'ry thing that hath breath praise the Lord.
16373,Praise ye the Lord! Praise ye the Lord!
16374,你們要讚美耶和華﹐在神的聖所讚美祂﹐

16385,Must I go and empty-handed? Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
16386,Not one day of service give Him. Lay no trophy at His feet?
16387,Must I go and empty-handed? Must I meet my Saviour so?
16388,Not one soul with which to greet Him: must I empty-handed go?
16389,"Not at death I shrink nor falter, for my Saviour saves me now;"
16390,"But to meet Him empty-handed, thought of that now clouds my brow."
16391,"O the years in sinning wasted; could I but recall them now,"
16392,"I would give them to my Saviour, to His will I'd gladly bow."
16393,"O ye saints, arouse, be earnest, up and work while yet 'tis day;"
16394,"Ere the night of death o'ertake thee, strive for souls while still you may."
16395,我豈可去﹐雙手空空﹖豈可如此見主面﹖
16396,從無一日為主作工﹐未有擄物獻主前。
16397,我豈可以空手見主﹖豈可雙手空空去﹖
16398,未領一人來歸基督﹗豈可雙手空空去﹖
16399,今日去世復有何恐﹖因為恩主已救我﹔
16400,但一思念雙手虛空﹐愁容滿面真難過﹗
16401,從前犯罪所廢歲月﹐假若現在能贖回﹐
16402,我必完全奉獻無缺﹐樂行主旨不再違。
16403,哦﹐願我們努力發奮﹐殷勤作工趁白日﹔
16404,死辰尚未臨到你身﹐熱心救人不停止。
16405,"Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched, weak and wounded, sick and sore;"

16408,"Come, ye needy, come and welcome; God's free bounty glorify;"
16409,"True belief and true repentance, every grace that brings us nigh,"
16410,"Without money, without money, come to Jesus Christ and buy."
16411,"Let not conscience make you linger, nor of fitness fondly dream;"
16412,All the fitness He requireth is to feel your need of Him:
16413,"This He gives you, this He gives you, 'tis the Spirit's rising beam."
16414,"Come, ye weary, heavy laden, lost and ruined by the fall;"
16415,"If you tarry till you're better, you will never come at all:"

16420,"Lo! th' incarnate God, ascended, pleads the merit of His blood;"
16421,"Venture on Him, venture wholly; let no other trust intrude:"
16422,"None but Jesus, none but Jesus, can do helpless sinners good."
16423,貧窮、軟弱、悲傷、憂愁﹐親愛罪人﹐請你來﹗
16424,耶穌等著要施拯救﹐滿了能力和憐愛﹔
16425,祂能救你﹗祂能救你﹗祂肯救你莫疑猜。
16426,祂要歡迎﹐來罷﹐放心﹐祂不棄絕任何人﹔
16427,實在懊悔﹐實在相信﹐你就必定能蒙恩﹔
16428,不用代價﹐不用代價﹐就可進入得救門。
16429,莫讓良心使你徘徊﹐或想怎樣纔配來﹔

16432,你心煩悶﹐你心悒怏﹐疲倦痛苦常失敗﹔
16433,如果你要等到改良﹐你就永遠不會來﹔
16434,耶穌釘死﹐耶穌釘死﹐是為罪人贖罪債。
16435,請你想起客西馬尼﹐救主如何流血汗﹔
16436,請你聽祂在髑髏地﹐如何臨死大聲喊﹕
16437,"""已經成了﹗""""已經成了﹗""罪人你今能無感﹖"
16438,祂的流血﹐已經滿足你神公義的要求﹐
16439,應當信服﹐完全信服﹐罪過就都得免宥﹔
16440,惟有耶穌﹐惟有耶穌﹐能作罪人的朋友。
16441,"I wish you knew my Jesus, and loved Him as I do,"
16442,"For if you knew my Jesus, then you would love Him too."
16443,"He gave His life at Calv'ry, the sacrifice for you:"
16444,"If you'll receive my Jesus, then you will love Him too."
16445,我願你認識耶穌﹐像我一樣愛祂﹔
16446,若你認識我耶穌﹐你也必然愛祂。
16447,祂捨命在各各他﹐為你付上贖價﹔
16448,若你接受我耶穌﹐你也必然愛祂。
16487,Love was when God became a man
16488,Locked in time and space without rank or place;
16489,"Love was God born of Jewish kin,"
16490,Just a carpenter with some fishermen.
16491,Love was when Jesus walked in history —
16492,Lovingly He brought a new life that's free;
16493,Love was God nailed to bleed and die
16494,To reach and love one such as I.
16495,Down where I could see love that reached to me;
16496,Love was God dying for my sin
16497,And so trapped was I my whole world caved in.
16498,Love was when Jesus rose to walk with me —
16499,Love was God — only He would try
16500,愛就是神成人樣式﹐
16501,尊榮皆捨棄﹐受時空限制﹔
16502,愛就是神降生猶大﹐
16503,與漁人為友﹐生活木匠家。
16504,愛就是耶穌行走於歷史﹐
16505,祂帶來新生﹐祂日日恩賜﹔
16506,愛就是主流血捨身﹐
16507,為拯救並愛如我罪人。
16508,愛就是神降卑為人﹐
16509,好使我得見祂愛我何深﹔
16510,愛就是主為我受死﹐
16511,當我被罪捆﹐欲脫無望時﹔
16512,愛就是復活主與我同行﹐
16513,祂日日賜我自由新生命﹔
16514,愛就是惟有神竟肯
16515,來拯救並愛如我罪人。
16608,"This one thing I know,"
16609,"Once I was blind, but now I can see —"
16610,This one thing I know.

17316,雖我無知﹐祂愛我﹐今我的愛全歸祂﹔
17317,祂領我常常誇勝﹐在祂寶血泉下。
17330,福音執事當宣告﹐主十字架的道﹐
17331,福音當傳得完全﹐基督纔會如願﹔

17333,祂是威武榮耀王﹐陰府一見就慌。
17334,主的救恩當宣告﹐不要稍微減少﹐
17335,每一部分都緊要﹐全傳大有功效﹔
17336,屬主的人當領會﹐祂死原是為罪
17337,但是祂往加略時﹐也帶罪人同陟。
17338,神的執事當宣告﹐當在四方傳報﹐

17436,靠主耶穌聖名﹐靠主耶穌聖名﹐我們必能得勝﹔
17437,靠主耶穌聖名﹐靠主耶穌聖名﹐撒但必要逃遁。

17448,我奉耶穌全能的名﹐跪在施恩寶座前﹐
17449,打敗許多黑暗軍兵﹐滅熄許多的火箭。
17450,全能名！全能名！我奉此名就得勝！
17451,全能名！全能名！撒但、罪、死﹐都無能。
17452,當我求告全能耶穌﹐撒但全軍都敗陣﹔
17453,耶穌﹐耶穌﹐全能耶穌！祢的大名是得勝！
17454,不久主頒有福命令﹐召我進入祂天國﹔
17455,那時全能耶穌的名﹐使我得登祂寶座！
17468,神的子民被寇﹐神豈不為復仇﹖
17469,"主口親說﹐祂必定""要""﹔我何必怕彼獠﹖"
17470,晝夜呼籲聲音﹐神豈不予垂聽﹖
17471,"我對你說﹐祂必趕""快""將敵從天下摔！"
17472,撒但如此壓迫﹐神豈不申斥責﹖
17473,我對你說﹐祂必定要立刻加以釘鐐。
17474,敵既這樣兇劇﹐主既這樣應許
17475,我們就當繼續呼籲﹐使敵早日結局。
17476,因此﹐我們應當比前更加堅剛﹐
17477,無晝無夜向神控告﹐把敵權勢盡掃。
17478,"Do you hear them coming, brother — thronging up the steeps of light,"

18179,"Till the world, all the world, His salvation shall know."
18180,"To the hardest of places He calls me to go,"
18181,No thinking of comfort or ease;
18182,"The world may pronounce me a dreamer, a fool,"
18183,Enough if the Master I please.
18184,"Oh, ye that are spending your leisure and pow'rs"
18185,In pleasures so foolish and fond;
18186,"Awake from your selfishness, folly and sin,"
18187,"And go to the regions beyond,"
18188,"There are other “lost sheep” that the Master must bring,"
18189,And they must the message be told;
18190,"He sends me to gather them out to all lands,"
18191,And welcome them back to His fold.
18192,到遠方﹐到萬國﹐我必去﹐我必去﹐
18193,到福音從未傳達之地﹔
18194,千萬人從未聞主大愛與憐惜﹐
18195,我必去報佳音不遲疑。
18196,到遠方﹐到萬國﹐我必去﹐我必去﹔
18197,向全地廣傳播主救恩﹐大應許。
18198,主呼召我前去—最艱苦的地區﹐
18199,莫貪戀這俗世的安逸﹔
18200,縱世人譏誚我空作夢、常癡愚﹐
18201,我只要討我主的歡喜。
18202,切不要再耗費你精力與生命﹐
18203,空追求己快樂與興趣﹔
18204,速速從你自私愚妄中得覺醒﹐
18205,遵主命速前往遠方去。
18206,我救主心所掛還有其他迷羊﹐
18207,他們亦需聽到主福音﹔
18208,主差遣我前往﹐將迷羊從各方
18209,領回圈與救主同歡欣。
18210,Only to be what He wants me to be
18211,Ev'ry moment of ev'ry day;
18212,Yielded completely to Jesus alone
18213,Ev'ry step of this pilgrim way;
18214,"Just to be clay in the potter's hands,"
18215,"Ready to do what His word commands,"
18216,Ev'ry moment of ev'ry day.
18217,我願作合乎祂心意的人，
18218,時刻活在祂的光中；
18219,全奉獻，全歸依，絕對順從，
18220,忠心跟隨直到路終。
18221,只作泥土在陶人手中，
18222,祂一切命令殷勤聽從；
18223,時刻活在祂的光中。
18297,"What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought,"
18298,Since Jesus came into my heart!
18299,"I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,"
18300,"Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,"
18301,"I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray,"
18302,"And my sins which were many are all washed away,"
18303,"I 'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,"
18304,"And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,"
18305,"There's a light in the valley of death now for me,"
18306,"And the gates of the City beyond I can see,"
18307,"I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,"
18308,"And I'm happy, so happy as onward I go,"
18309,我生命有何等奇妙的大改變，
18310,自耶穌來住在我心；
18311,我久慕的光輝，今照耀我魂間，
18312,自耶穌來住在我心。
18313,自耶穌來住在我心，
18314,喜樂潮溢我魂，如海濤之滾滾，
18315,我良心已平安，不再受罪控告，
18316,我罪惡的捆綁，從我身全脫掉，
18317,感覺中的福樂，既變色又失味，
18318,生活中的思慮，也不能再纏累，
18319,無窮盡的活泉，我裡面已飽足，
18320,因已有甜美愛，不再感生活苦，
18321,舊歷史全都過，無什麼可留戀，
18322,這有福的盼望，吸引我直望天，
18351,I've been happy ever since I made the start;
18352,"Days are brighter, burdens lighter,"
18353,"Jesus' love is bubbling, bubbling in my heart."
18354,哈利路亞，哈利路亞，
18355,我真歡樂自我隨主向前進；
18356,日增光明，擔子減輕，
18357,主的愛正湧溢，湧溢在我心。
18358,“No condemnation!” precious word!
18359,"Consider it, my soul!"
18360,"Thy sins were all on Jesus laid,"
18361,His stripes have made thee whole.
18362,In heav'n the blood forever speaks
18363,In God's omniscient ear;
18364,"The saints, as jewels on His heart,"
18365,Jesus doth ever bear.
18366,"“No condemnation!” — O my soul,"
18367,"'Tis God that speaks the word,"
18368,Perfect in comeliness art thou
18369,"In Christ, the risen Lord."
18370,"Teach me, O God, to fix mine eyes"
18371,"On Christ, the Lord, my King,"
18372,"So shall I love Thy precious will,"
18373,And of Thy glories sing.
18374,“不再定罪！”何等希奇！
18375,我魂，應當歡喜！
18376,你罪已經都歸耶穌，
18377,祂死使你得甦。
18378,寶血為我永遠在天，
18379,對神說出美言；
18380,主看聖徒如同奇珍，
18381,天天照顧惟殷。
18382,“不再定罪！”我的魂哪，
18383,這是神說的話；
18384,你在基督復活主裡，
18385,已是完全美麗。
18386,神阿，教我注目仰望
18387,救主基督，我王；
18388,我纔會愛祢的心情，
18389,纔會榮耀祂名。
18453,"Somehow I know that Christ is mine,"
18454,"No pow'r can take me out of His care,"
18455,"He holds me with His arm divine,"
18456,And in His Kingdom I have a share.
18457,"Somehow His love will never let me go,"
18458,Somehow He loves me better than I know.
18459,"Somehow, someday when life is o'er,"
18460,I'll dwell with Him for evermore.
18461,"Somehow I feel that He is near,"
18462,"Whene'er I'm tempted to go astray,"
18463,"His presence calms my ev'ry fear,"
18464,And keeps me singing along the way.
18465,"Somehow I hear His gently call,"
18466,"Whene'er I'm lonely and need a friend,"
18467,"His mercy lifts me when I fall,"
18468,And will support me until the end.
18469,怎麼？竟然主已屬我！
18470,無能可奪我離主恩護；
18471,祂親用聖手扶持我，
18472,使我能有分於祂國度。
18473,不知如何，祂愛總不放鬆！
18474,不知如何，祂愛遠超測度！
18475,一日，此生要成過去；
18476,我要與主永在一起。
18477,怎麼？竟然主已親近，
18478,當試探誘我誤入歧途；
18479,有主同在憂懼散盡，
18480,邊行邊歌唱，樂行天路。
18481,怎麼？竟聞主聲呼召，
18482,當我覺孤單，極需一友；
18483,主恩扶持我免跌倒，
18484,祂要供應我直到盡頭。
18485,"O happy day that fixed my choice on Thee,"
18486,My Saviour and my God!
18487,"Well may this glowing heart rejoice,"
18488,And tell its raptures all abroad.
18489,"Happy Day, Happy Day,"
18490,When Jesus washed my sins away!
18491,"He taught me how to watch and pray,"
18492,And live rejoicing ev'ry day;
18493,"O happy bond, that seals my vows"
18494,To Him who merits all my love!
18495,"Let cheerful anthems fill His house,"
18496,While to that sacred shrine I move.
18497,'Tis done: the great transaction's done;
18498,I am my Lord's and He is mine;
18499,"He drew me, and I followed on,"
18500,Charmed to confess the voice divine.
18501,"Now rest, my long-divided heart;"
18502,"Fixed on this blissful center, rest;"
18503,"Nor ever from my Lord depart,"
18504,With Him of ev'ry good possessed.
18505,"High Heav'n that hears the solemn vow,"
18506,"That vow renew'd shall daily hear,"
18507,"Till in life's latest hour I bow,"
18508,"And bless, in death, a bond so dear."
18509,今日何日！我意立定，
18510,揀選我神和我救主！
18511,我心歡樂如火熒熒，
18512,將此歡樂到處傳述。
18513,快樂日!快樂日！
18514,耶穌救我，使我歡樂！
18515,贖罪寶血洗我罪惡！
18516,生命活水解我乾渴！
18517,快樂日！快樂日！
18518,耶穌救我，使我歡樂！
18519,快樂之約繫我於主，
18520,唯祂配受所有愛敬；
18521,願我歌唱讚美不住，
18522,當我向主寶座前行。
18523,此約既定，永不反悔，
18524,主今屬我，我也屬主；
18525,祂既吸引，我必跟隨，
18526,歡然答應祂的招呼。
18527,前我二意，今可安定，
18528,讓主作我惟一中心；
18529,注定於祂，永不別傾，
18530,有祂，就有一切福分。
18531,今在主前立定此意，
18532,更願此意與日俱新；
18533,直到臨終雙目垂閉，
18534,進入永遠與祂更親。
18535,"I'm so happy, and here's the reason why,"
18536,Jesus took my burdens all away.
18537,"Now I'm singing as the days go by,"
18538,"Once my heart was heavy with a load of sin,"
18539,"Jesus took the burden, gave me peace within."
18540,我真快樂，原因就是這樣，
18541,耶穌把我重擔全挪開；
18542,我今歌唱，天天都歌唱，
18543,耶穌把我重擔全挪開。
18544,從前我心充滿罪惡的重擔，
18545,耶穌除去我重擔賜我平安；
18546,"Awake, my soul, to joyful lays,"
18547,And sing thy great Redeemer's praise;
18548,"He justly claims a song from me,"
18549,"His lovingkindness, oh, how free!"
18550,"Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,"
18551,"He saw me ruined by the fall,"
18552,"Yet loved me, not withstanding all;"
18553,"He saved me from my lost estate,"
18554,"His lovingkindness, oh, how great!"
18555,"Though numerous hosts of mighty foes,"
18556,"Though earth and hell my way oppose,"
18557,"He safely leads my soul along,"
18558,"His lovingkindness, oh, how strong!"
18559,"When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,"
18560,"Has gathered thick and thundered loud,"
18561,"He near my soul has always stood,"
18562,"His lovingkindness, oh, how good!"
18563,Soon shall we mount and soar away
18564,"To the bright realms of endless day,"
18565,"And sing, with rapture and surprise,"
18566,"His lovingkindness, in the skies,"
18567,"His lovingkindness, in the skies."
18568,我魂，醒來，快樂歌唱：
18569,你的救主何等慈愛！
18570,祂是合理得我頌揚，
18571,祂的慈愛何等慷慨！
18572,祂的慈愛，祂的慈愛，
18573,因為墮落我遭淪毀！
18574,但祂仍然愛我不顧；
18575,救我脫離死亡地位，
18576,祂的慈愛何等豐富！
18577,世俗雖盛，聲勢可怕！
18578,陰府的門雖阻前路；
18579,但祂領我平安回家，
18580,祂的慈愛何等堅固！
18581,試煉有似烏雲密佈！
18582,雷聲隆隆，凡百可畏；
18583,但我救主時加保護，
18584,祂的慈愛何等佳美！
18585,地上帳棚，不久拆毀，
18586,經過幽谷，心頹力倦；
18587,最後一息仍將讚美：
18588,祂的慈愛，何等完全！
18589,祂的慈愛祂的慈愛，
18590,祂的慈愛何等完全！
18591,"He's the Saviour of my soul, My Jesus, my Jesus;"
18592,"He's the Saviour of my soul, He's the Saviour of my soul."
18593,"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!"
18594,祂是我靈魂的救主，主耶穌，主耶穌；
18595,祂是我靈魂的救主，祂是我一切的主。
18596,耶穌，耶穌，耶穌，耶穌！
18597,"Come, ye that love the Lord,"
18598,"And let your joys be known,"
18599,"Join in a song with sweet accord,"
18600,And thus surround the throne.
18601,Rejoice! His grace is free!
18602,"Full pardon granted, grace is free!"
18603,Rejoice! His grace is free.
18604,Let those refuse to sing
18605,Who never knew our God;
18606,Must speak their joys abroad.
18607,The hill of Zion yields
18608,"A thousand sacred sweets,"
18609,Or walk the golden streets.
18610,"Then let our songs abound,"
18611,And every tear be dry;
18612,To fairer worlds on high.
18613,愛主的人都來﹐
18614,將你喜樂敞開﹔
18615,甘甜唱著主的奇愛﹐
18616,同到寶座前來。
18617,樂哉﹐白白恩典﹗
18618,白白恩典﹐完全赦免﹐
18619,未識主名的人﹐
18620,讓他緘默無聲﹔
18621,應當喜樂歡騰。
18622,未入榮耀之城﹐
18623,未履精金之街；
18624,預嘗何等喜悅。
18625,故當高聲歌唱﹐
18626,忘記所有憂傷﹔
18627,天上更美家鄉。
18628,Jesus found me when afar I wandered;
18629,Bro't me pardon from the throne above;
18630,"Gave me peace that passeth understanding,"
18631,Joy unspeakable and full of love.
18632,Praise the Lord! My soul is filled with glory!
18633,Praise the Lord! I love to tell the story
18634,"Of His grace that keeps and gives me vict'ry,"
18635,"And I'm shouting, glory! Till I get home."
18636,當我罪中流蕩，耶穌尋我，
18637,祂從寶座赦免我罪過；
18638,賜我出人意外屬天平安，
18639,並以愛與喜樂來充滿。
18640,讚美主，榮耀充滿我心魂！
18641,讚美主，我愛傳揚主救恩！
18642,靠主恩，我能得勝無懼怕，
18643,今我歡呼：“榮耀！”直奔天家。
18723,"I love Thee, Lord;"
18724,Yet 'tis no love of mine That goeth forth to that great heart of Thine;
18725,'Tis Thine own love which Thou hast given me
18726,"Returning back, O loving Lord, to Thee."
18727,主，我愛祢。
18728,但不是我有愛能以傾入愛主廣大胸壞；
18729,是祢大愛今在我心湧溢，
18730,迫我向主歸還祢愛，愛祢。
18731,"In all Thy work, O Lord, Thou didst"
18732,At Calv'ry's cross once come to rest;
18733,"Yet Thou art working still today,"
18734,But in another form expressed.
18735,Thy saving pow'r Thou still dost show;
18736,"Thou still dost speak, enlighten, guide;"
18737,Thou and the Spirit in one stream
18738,Sweep many in Thy living tide.
18739,Through Him Thy power's not withheld;
18740,Through Him Thy working does not cease;
18741,"Thou still dost comfort and command,"
18742,"Encourage, strengthen, and release."
18743,"Since Thou dost in the Spirit dwell,"
18744,"His coming means that Thou hast come,"
18745,"And His indwelling is Thine own,"
18746,For Thou and He are truly one.
18747,He executes within my heart
18748,"All Thy desires and Thy demands,"
18749,As for the Father here on earth
18750,Thou hast performed all His commands.
18751,By knowing Him we know Thyself;
18752,Obeying Him we Thee obey;
18753,"Allowing Him ourselves to fill,"
18754,"We're filled with Thee, O wondrous way!"
18755,"Thou art not far away in heav'n,"
18756,"Leaving us here alone, apart;"
18757,But Thou art still on earth; how grand!
18758,Thou livest right within my heart.
18759,主，祢所有一切工作，
18760,並非到了十架為止；
18761,祢今乃是仍舊生活，
18762,從祢另一形態表示。
18763,祢今仍舊施行拯救，
18764,仍舊說話，仍舊引導；
18765,祢與聖靈已成一流，
18766,仍舊光照，使人仆倒。
18767,藉祂，祢不停止能力，
18768,藉祂，祢不停止運行；
18769,祢的感動，祢的鼓勵，
18770,祢仍安慰，祢仍命令。
18771,自從祢藉聖靈內住，
18772,祂來就是祢又來地；
18773,祂的內住是祢充盈，
18774,祂代表祢，祂又是祢。
18775,祂今在我心中執行，
18776,祢的一切命令希翼；
18777,有如從前祢在世境，
18778,執行父神所有旨意。
18779,我們識祂，就是識祢，
18780,服祂，就是服祢旨意；
18781,我們被祂滲透、洋溢，
18782,就是充滿祢的自己。
18783,祢今不是遠在高天，
18784,不是一去就不復返；
18785,乃是仍舊在這世間，
18786,奇哉！並住在我心坎。
18787,"“Spring up, spring up, spring up,"
18788,"O well! Let the living waters flow,”"
18789,"Tarry not, O weary pilgrim,"
18790,God's own promise here to know.
18791,"Sing unto the well with boldness,"
18792,Bid the water to o'erflow;
18793,With'ring souls shall leap with gladness.
18794,Lo! how living waters flow.
18795,"Christ the rock has long been smitten,"
18796,Living water ever flows.
18797,"Sweet, fresh, cool stream never ceasing,"
18798,Quenching all the thirsty souls.
18799,'Tis the heavenly endurance
18800,That it brings with love divine.
18801,"Since I've seen my Saviour's glory,"
18802,How the waters stir my soul.
18803,What contentment! O how joyous-
18804,Since the water flood'd my soul.
18805,One day at the well arriving
18806,"No more could I find its flow,"
18807,How perplexing and distressing!
18808,To the Lord in tears I fled.
18809,Stones and earth had blocked the passage.
18810,Sadly then I bowed my head.
18811,"Suddenly appeared my Saviour,"
18812,With His holy searching light.
18813,"“Stop your struggling and your striving,"
18814,Only give to me thine heart.
18815,With my strength and rod so mighty
18816,"Thor'ly I will dig again,"
18817,"Root out idols and obstructions,"
18818,And the spring will flow again!
18819,井阿！請你湧上水來！
18820,請將活水來湧流！
18821,疲倦客旅，為何等待？
18822,這是父神的應許。
18823,只要憑信向井歌唱，
18824,甘甜活水就湧流；
18825,枯萎心靈頓覺歡暢，
18826,看哪！活水正湧流。
18827,基督靈磐早經裂開，
18828,活水早已在湧流；
18829,清涼甘甜永不中斷，
18830,澆灌乾渴的群眾。
18831,滿帶天上非常能耐，
18832,滿帶非常的大愛；
18833,自從我識救主丰采，
18834,此水流動在我懷。
18835,何等滿足！何等喜歡！
18836,自從我心湧活泉；
18837,忽然有日來至井旁，
18838,發現活水已中斷。
18839,我心充滿莫名傍徨，
18840,流淚投向救主前；
18841,泥土、石塊，充塞心房，
18842,失望痛苦常悲歎。
18843,尊貴救主忽然來蒞，
18844,用祂臉光來尋搜；
18845,“勿憑己意，勿用己力，
18846,只需將心交我手。”
18847,主要用祂能力權杖，
18848,再將此心來挖透；
18849,心愛偶像盡都拋棄，
18850,看哪！活水又暢流。
18851,"Descend on me, Spirit of love!"
18852,"Lift me into the realms above,"
18853,With joy to fill my heart!
18854,"Come make this weary soul of mine,"
18855,Full of Thy peace and grace divine. ]
18856,May glory fill my eyes.
18857,Thy Spirit is my pledge of hope
18858,To set my feet on utmost heights
18859,Of Canaan's glorious sight!
18860,"There springs of life are flowing free,"
18861,And fruits of Paradise I see
18862,And taste unendingly!
18863,Thy Spirit in surpassing love
18864,Indwells a wretched man like me.
18865,My heart Thine throne shall be!
18866,Thy loving power ever pour
18867,On me to make Thy presence sure.
18868,Depart from me no more!
18869,聖靈的愛從天傾瀉，
18870,將我高舉諸天境界，
18871,喜樂滿足我心。
18872,使我困苦疲倦的魂，
18873,忽然平安甜蜜充盈，
18874,榮耀滿我眼睛。
18875,聖靈是我希望定質，
18876,使我立足最高天次–
18877,迦南榮耀之境。
18878,生命活水長流不止，
18879,樂園所有佳美果實，
18880,永遠享用不盡。
18881,聖靈的愛超越萬愛，
18882,以這賤軀作祢居宅，
18883,復以我心為座。
18884,甘甜能力不斷灌注，
18885,使我經歷救主內住，
18886,永遠不再失落。
18887,"Holy Ghost with light divine, Shine upon this heart of mine;"
18888,"Chase the shades of night away, Turn my darkness into day."
18889,"Holy Ghost, with power divine, Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;"
18890,Long hath sin without control Held dominion o'er my soul.
18891,"Holy Ghost, with joy divine, Cheer this saddened heart of mine;"
18892,"Bid my many woes depart, Heal my wounded, bleeding heart."
18893,"Holy Spirit, all divine, Dwell within this heart of mine;"
18894,"Cast down every idol-throne, Reign supreme — and reign alone."
18895,聖靈發出祂光芒，榮耀充滿我心房；
18896,黑暗陰翳消除盡，使黑夜變為光明。
18897,聖靈彰顯祂恩能，我心完全洗潔淨。
18898,願我罪身釘十架，我靈魂歸祢管轄。
18899,聖靈恩惠賜歡欣，撫慰我的憂鬱心，
18900,使愁苦遠遠離開，醫治我傷痛情懷。
18901,聖靈降臨來保惠，永遠安居我心內；
18902,偶像座位盡除淨，使主在我心為尊。
18903,"Come, Lord, in Thy Spirit come,"
18904,Lo! We stretch our hands to Thee;
18905,"From the Father to the Son,"
18906,Let us now Thy glory see.
18907,"Come, oh Lord, Great Spirit, come! Let the mighty deed be done!"
18908,"Satisfy our soul's desire, See us waiting for the fire,"
18909,"Waiting, waiting, See us waiting for the fire."
18910,On the alter now we lay
18911,"Soul and body, mind and will;"
18912,"All the evil passions slay,"
18913,"Come, and every corner fill."
18914,"Now the sacrifice we make,"
18915,"Though as dear as a right eye,"
18916,"For our blessed Saviour's sake,"
18917,Who for us did bleed and die.
18918,"Now, by faith, the gift I claim,"
18919,Bought for me by blood divine;
18920,Through the all-prevailing Name
18921,All the promises are mine.
18922,我今舉手向祢請，
18923,要祢賜下焚燒靈；
18924,焚燒一切所歡喜，
18925,不留一點為自己。
18926,求祢賜下焚燒靈，成我畢生大事情；
18927,滿足我心的要求，用火焚燒到無有；
18928,等候，等候，我們等候焚燒靈。
18929,我今壇上來獻祭，
18930,擺上全人靈魂體；
18931,求將惡慾全解脫，
18932,並來充滿每角落。
18933,我今真切已犧牲
18934,我所寶貝的一生；
18935,完全為著寶貝主，
18936,因祂流血來救贖。
18937,我今以信來領取
18938,血下權利的給予；
18939,靠祢得勝的名字，
18940,所有應許成現實。
18941,Are you looking for the fullness of the blessing of the Lord
18942,In your heart and life today?
18943,"Claim the promise of your Father, come according to His word,"
18944,In the blessed oldtime way.
18945,"He will fill your heart today to overflowing,"
18946,"As the Lord commandeth you,“Bring your vessels, not a few;”"
18947,He will fill your heart today to overflowing
18948,With the Holy Ghost and pow'r.
18949,"Bring your empty earthen vessels, clean thro' Jesus precious blood,"
18950,"Come, ye needy, one and all;"
18951,"And in human consecration wait before the throne of God,"
18952,Till the Holy Ghost shall fall.
18953,"Like the cruse of oil unfailing is His grace forevermore,"
18954,And His love unchanging still;
18955,"And according to His promise with the Holy Ghost and pow'r,"
18956,He will ev'ry vessel fill.
18957,你是否已長久渴慕得著主豐滿福分，
18958,今就在你心傾注？
18959,何不按照主話來得父神應許的聖靈，
18960,如當日五旬祝福？
18961,現在主要充滿你心，直到滿溢，
18962,正如主神聖吩咐：“將器皿多多騰出！”
18963,現今主要充滿你心，直到滿溢，
18964,充滿聖靈和能力。
18965,帶上你倒空的器皿，藉主寶血得潔淨，
18966,來吧！你這窮乏人；
18967,謙卑俯伏神寶座前，一心奉獻成為聖，
18968,直到聖靈從上傾。
18969,主恩好比無限膏油，傾倒充滿器皿裡，
18970,祂愛仍然不搖移；
18971,要照父的寶貴應許，將神膏油與能力，
18972,今日，充滿器皿裡。
18973,"Oh, Jesus, Lord, when Thou on earth"
18974,"Accompanied Thy faithful band,"
18975,"It seemed thy knew, but knew Thee not,"
18976,Thyself they did not understand.
18977,"They heard Thy voice, beheld Thy form,"
18978,Thy beauteous stature unforgot!
18979,"Thy crowded 'round Thee, met Thy gaze,"
18980,"But who Thou art, they knew it not."
18981,As they of old we too are veiled;
18982,We've known Thee long apparently;
18983,"Yet if we say we know, at best"
18984,We know Thee not transparently.
18985,"But in the Spirit now Thou art,"
18986,Another Comforter become;
18987,"Reveal Thyself within my heart,"
18988,Since to Thy temple Thou hast come.
18989,"With Thy blest Spirit, Lord, fill me,"
18990,Fill every corner of my soul;
18991,"May Thou inspire my every part,"
18992,"Oh may Thou touch, renew the whole."
18993,The Spirit then revealing make
18994,"Thyself more real within my heart,"
18995,"That ear not hear, nor eye may see"
18996,How very real to me Thou art.
18997,When Thou in mercy dost reveal
18998,"And give Thyself in Spirit thus,"
18999,"What in the world can be more real,"
19000,More true than what Thou art to us?
19001,"Thy Spirit, Lord, in mine, I pray,"
19002,"O'erflow my being as a flood,"
19003,That every part with glory shine
19004,And everywhere be Thee and God.
19005,"How close we are in such a life,"
19006,In one is blended earth with heav'n;
19007,Thy presence sweetly fills our souls;
19008,Our hearts are to Thy praises giv'n.
19009,哦，主耶穌，當祢在地，
19010,他們與祢多年同處；
19011,但是他們對祢自己，
19012,似識不識似悟不悟。
19013,他們聽過祢的聲音，
19014,他們見過祢的丰姿，
19015,他們擠過祢的肉身，
19016,但祢是誰，似知不知。
19017,我們好像蓋重幔子，
19018,彷彿知道，又不透明，
19019,說不認識，早已認識，
19020,說已認識，認識不清。
19021,但祢今已在靈裏面，
19022,成為另一位保惠師；
19023,祢已使我成祢聖殿，
19024,在我裡面，將祢啟示。
19025,但願祢用聖靈充滿
19026,在我全人每一角落；
19027,沒有一處不受祢感，
19028,沒有一處不被祢摸。
19029,求祢自己藉靈顯現，
19030,加倍實在，在我心懷；
19031,無耳所聽，無目所見，
19032,無手所摸，如此實在。
19033,當祢憐憫，肯來啟示，
19034,將祢自己給了我們，
19035,世上有誰比祢更實？
19036,世上有何比祢更真？
19037,求祢用靈從我的靈，
19038,如同洪水漫溢全人–
19039,到處榮耀，到處光明，
19040,到處是祢，到處是神。
19041,這個生活何等親近！
19042,祢使我已在地若天；
19043,讚美滿口，喜樂滿心，
19044,同在滿魂，一切甘甜。
19045,"Come in, O come! The door stand open now;"
19046,"I knew Thy voice, Lord Jesus, it was Thou."
19047,The sun has set long since; the storm begin;
19048,"'Tis time for Thee, my Saviour, O come in!"
19049,"Alas, ill-order'd shows the dreary room;"
19050,"The household stuff lies heap'd amidst the gloom,"
19051,"The table empty stands, the couch undress'd;"
19052,"Ah, what a welcome for th'Eternal Guest!"
19053,"Yet welcome, and tonight, this doleful scene"
19054,Is e'en itself my cause to hail Thee in;
19055,This dark confusion e'en at once demands
19056,"Thine own bright presence, Lord and ord'ring hands."
19057,"I seek no more to alter things, or mend,"
19058,Before the coming of so great a Friend;
19059,All were at best unseemly; and 'twere ill
19060,Beyond all else to keep Thee waiting still.
19061,"Come, not to find, but make this troubled heart"
19062,A dwelling worthy of Thee as Thou art;
19063,"To chase the gloom, the terror, and the sin;"
19064,"Come, all Thyself, yea come, Lord Jesus, in!"
19065,進來，我主，心門現已全開，
19066,我識聲音，我知是祢等待；
19067,自己無力，祢又被我見外，
19068,正是時候，我主，求祢進來！
19069,可憐！荒涼房間，何等零亂，
19070,堆堆都是雜物，何等難看，
19071,牆壁污穢，器具收拾不淨，
19072,我主，這是我給祢的歡迎。
19073,但是，我真歡迎你這貴賓，
19074,我的情形是我歡迎原因；
19075,我主，如此紛亂，需要接受
19076,祢的同在和祢安排的手。
19077,在這偉大朋友顯現之前，
19078,我不尋求補救或者改變；
19079,我的最好還是非常難看，
19080,叫祢再等，乃是最壞習慣。
19081,求來，不是發現，乃是要使
19082,這個亂心配作祢的居止。
19083,除去黑暗、恐怕、犯罪失敗，
19084,進來，我主，祢的所有全來。
19085,"Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,"
19086,"That a time could ever be,"
19087,"When I proudly said to Jesus,"
19088,"“All of self and none of Thee. """
19089,"""All of self, and none of Thee."""
19090,Yet He found me; I beheld Him
19091,Bleeding on th'accursed tree
19092,"And my wistful heart said faintly,"
19093,"""Some of self and some of Thee. """
19094,"""Some of self and some of Thee."""
19095,"""Some of self, and some of Thee."""
19096,"Day by day His tender mercy,"
19097,"Healing, helping, full and free,"
19098,"Brought me lower while I whispered,"
19099,"""Less of self and more of Thee. """
19100,"""Less of self and more of Thee."""
19101,"""Less of self, and more of Thee."""
19102,"Higher than the highest heavens,"
19103,"Deeper than the deepest sea,"
19104,"Lord, Thy love at last has conquered;"
19105,"""None of self and all of Thee. """
19106,"""None of self, and all of Thee. """
19107,何等慚愧﹐何等痛悔﹐
19108,當我流淚想當時﹐
19109,如何剛硬拒主深愛﹐
19110,竟敢驕傲對主說﹕
19111,專為己﹐全不為祢﹐
19112,專為己﹐全不為祢﹗
19113,竟敢驕傲對主說：
19114,祂愛尋我，開我心眼，
19115,見祂十架流血景；
19116,“父啊﹐赦免！”深感我心﹐
19117,我就微弱向主說：
19118,雖為己﹐少許為祢！
19119,醫治！扶持！釋放！
19120,滿溢！祂愛洋溢終不息！
19121,甜蜜堅強勝我剛硬﹐
19122,使我自卑低聲說：
19123,少為己﹐更多為祢！
19124,祂愛高過最高天庭﹐
19125,深過最深的海洋；
19126,主﹐祢得勝﹐我今服矣！
19127,允我誠懇的禱祈：
19128,不為己﹐全都為祢！
19129,How can I ever stay away and grieve
19130,Thy Spirit all the day
19131,While Thou dost wait for me? While Thou dost wait for me!
19132,I now am willing to return
19133,"And wait no longer, for I yearn"
19134,"Hence-forth to follow Thee, Hence-forth to follow Thee."
19135,I offer now without reserve
19136,All that I am and all I have
19137,"Thy purpose to fulfill, Thy purpose to fulfill."
19138,"Oh, may the Lord accept and keep,"
19139,That henceforth I may only seek
19140,"To do the Father's will, To do the Father's will."
19141,"When I look back, what grief and shame"
19142,"That I've brought none to trust Thy name,"
19143,"Thy word I've locked within, Thy word I've locked within."
19144,"Oh, may the Lord anointing give"
19145,"And richly through my being live,"
19146,"That I may speak of Him, That I may speak of Him."
19147,"My Lord is so gracious to me,"
19148,Exceeds what my best friend can be;
19149,"I fain would be His bride, I fain would be His bride,"
19150,"I'd share His life and suffer loss,"
19151,"Accepting willingly the cross,"
19152,"With Him identified, With Him identified."
19153,我豈可再冷淡退後，
19154,使神聖靈終日擔憂，
19155,救主也在等候，救主也在等候！
19156,我今願意轉身回頭，
19157,不再留戀，不再逗遛，
19158,就此跟主而走，就此跟主而走！
19159,我今將我所是所有，
19160,完全奉獻，一無保留，
19161,從今直到永久，從今直到永久；
19162,惟願恩主悅納保守，
19163,使我今後無望無求，
19164,惟願神旨成就，惟願神旨成就。
19165,回顧已往，又慚又羞，
19166,無一靈魂是我所救–
19167,救恩被我扣留，救恩被我扣留；
19168,今求恩主用祢膏油，
19169,將我全人厚厚澆透，
19170,使成救恩出口，使成救恩出口。
19171,恩主一向施恩深厚，
19172,待我遠勝知己愛友，
19173,我願作祂配偶，我願作祂配偶；
19174,今後向主時常依投，
19175,十字苦架甘心接受，
19176,將主生命流露，將主生命流露。
19177,"Oh, for a closer walk with God,"
19178,A calm and heav'nly frame;
19179,A light to shine upon the road
19180,That leads me to the Lamb!
19181,"Where is the blessedness I knew,"
19182,When first I saw the Lord?
19183,Where is the soul-refreshing view
19184,Of Jesus and His word?
19185,What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
19186,How sweet their memory still!
19187,But they have left an aching void
19188,The world can never fill.
19189,"Return, O holy Dove, return,"
19190,Sweet messenger of rest!
19191,I hate the sins that made Thee mourn
19192,And drove Thee from my breast.
19193,"The dearest idol I have known,"
19194,"Whate'er that idol be,"
19195,"Help me to tear it from Thy throne,"
19196,And worship only Thee.
19197,"So shall my walk be close with God,"
19198,Calm and serene my frame;
19199,So purer light shall mark the road
19200,That leads me to the Lamb.
19201,願更與神親密同行，
19202,心境安靜、屬天；
19203,願光照明我的途徑，
19204,直到救主身邊。
19205,初次見主，我的安舒，
19206,現今是在哪裡？
19207,當我初次發現耶穌，
19208,喜樂消逝何地？
19209,從前我享何等交通，
19210,回憶仍是甘甜！
19211,現今留下痛苦虛空，
19212,無何可以補滿。
19213,回來，聖鴿！求祢即回，
19214,甘甜、安息使者！
19215,我恨使祢生悲的罪，
19216,使祢離我若捨。
19217,我所認識，不論甚麼，
19218,最可寶貝偶像，
19219,使我扯它離祢寶座，
19220,對祢完全傾向。
19221,我是如此與神同行，
19222,有光照明我的途徑，
19223,直到救主身邊！
19288,On toward the goal! press on!
19289,Alone yet unafraid;
19290,"He cut the path who beckons thee,"
19291,"On then, and undismayed!"
19292,The eyes that are a flame
19293,"Are watching thee, what then are men?"
19294,"What matter praise, or blame?"
19295,"Look not behind thee now,"
19296,"When just ahead lies His ""Well done,"""
19297,And crowns await thy brow.
19298,"Blind, deaf and sometimes dumb"
19299,"Along the blood-marked, uphill way,"
19300,"Hard after Christ, press on!"
19301,當向標竿力前！
19302,雖然孤單﹐不變；
19303,那開路者現在召你﹐
19304,所以當前勿延。
19305,主眼睛像火燄﹐
19306,正在看你；人算甚麼？
19307,何必管他喜厭！
19308,不要再望後面；
19309,因為前頭就是獎賞﹐
19310,主要賜給冠冕。
19311,塞耳、啞口、閉眼﹐
19312,在崎嶇的血跡路上﹐
19313,緊隨基督向前！
19393,"God in heaven hath a treasure,"
19394,Riches none may count or tell;
19395,Hath a deep eternal pleasure
19396,"Christ the Son, He loveth well."
19397,"God hath here on earth a treasure,"
19398,None but He its price may know
19399,"Deep, unfathomable pleasure,"
19400,Christ revealed in saints below.
19401,"God in tongues of fire descending,"
19402,Chosen vessels thus to fill
19403,"With the treasure never ending,"
19404,Ever spent — unfailing still.
19405,God's own hand the vessels filling
19406,"From the glory far above,"
19407,Longing hearts forever stilling
19408,With the riches of His love.
19409,"Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted,"
19410,"Glorious calling, saint, is thine;"
19411,"Let the Lord but find thee emptied,"
19412,Living branch in Christ the vine!
19413,"Vessels of the world's despising,"
19414,"Vessels weak and poor and base,"
19415,"Bearing wealth God's heart is prizing,"
19416,Glory from Christ's blessed face.
19417,"Oh to be but emptier, lowlier,"
19418,"Mean, unnoticed and unknown,"
19419,"And to God a vessel holier,"
19420,Filled with Christ and Christ alone!
19421,"Naught of earth to cloud the glory,"
19422,"Naught of self the light to dim,"
19423,"Telling forth His wondrous story,"
19424,Emptied to be filled with Him.
19425,神在天上有一寶貝，
19426,豐富無人能言述；
19427,永遠心愛祂所寶貴，
19428,就是祂子主基督。
19429,神在地上有一寶貝，
19430,價值惟有神知悉；
19431,極深、心愛、人難測窺：
19432,基督啟示我心裡。
19433,神藉火燄舌頭臨到，
19434,用這永遠無窮盡、
19435,取用不竭的無價寶，
19436,充滿所選的器皿。
19437,神從天上榮耀裡頭，
19438,親來充滿這器皿；
19439,用祂愛的無限富有，
19440,滿足所有渴慕心。
19441,雖受折磨、試煉、試探，
19442,榮耀呼召仍不變；
19443,葡萄樹枝與樹相聯，
19444,向主倒空你自己。
19445,泥土器皿世人鄙視，
19446,軟弱、貧窮又卑賤；
19447,裝著寶貝神聖火焰，
19448,將主榮耀來彰顯。
19449,願我更加倒空、謙卑，
19450,不為人知、不顯揚；
19451,作神器皿，更為尊貴，
19452,充滿基督的榮光！
19453,無何事物遮此榮光，
19454,也無自己的遮蔽；
19455,將這奇妙救恩宣揚，
19456,倒空、充滿祂自己。
19457,Thro' the night of doubt and sorrow
19458,"Onward goes the pilgrim band,"
19459,"Singing songs of expectation,"
19460,Marching to the Promised Land.
19461,"Clear before us thro' the darkness,"
19462,Gleams and burns the guiding Light;
19463,"Brother clasps the hand of brother,"
19464,Stepping fearless thro' the night.
19465,One the light of God's own presence
19466,"O'er His ransomed people shed,"
19467,"Chasing far the gloom and terror,"
19468,Bright'ning all the path we tread;
19469,"One the object of our journey,"
19470,"One the faith which never tires,"
19471,"One the earnest looking forward,"
19472,One the hope our God inspires.
19473,One the strain that lips of thousands
19474,Lift as from the heart of one;
19475,"One the conflict, one the peril,"
19476,One the march in God begun;
19477,One the gladness of rejoicing
19478,"On the far eternal shore,"
19479,Where the One Almighty Father
19480,Reigns in love for evermore.
19481,"Onward, therefore, pilgrim brothers,"
19482,Onward with the cross our aid;
19483,"Bear its shame, and fight its battle"
19484,Till we rest beneath its shade.
19485,"Soon shall come the great awaking,"
19486,Soon the rending of the tomb;
19487,"Then the scatt'ring of all shadows,"
19488,And the end of toil and gloom.
19489,我們乃是朝聖旅客﹐
19490,經過疑惑與憂悒﹔
19491,手拿枴杖﹐口唱詩歌﹐
19492,面向神的應許地。
19493,白日時候﹐黑夜時候﹐
19494,雲柱火柱正引領﹔
19495,弟兄手握弟兄的手﹐
19496,一步一步在進行。
19497,同一位神同在亮光﹐
19498,照明所有得贖人﹔
19499,除去疑惑﹐除去愚妄﹐
19500,照明我們的疑問。
19501,同一目的在於高天﹐
19502,同一信心不疲倦﹐
19503,同一定質來看前面﹐
19504,同一希望得完全。
19505,同一詩歌千萬嘴唇﹐
19506,同唱有如只一心﹔
19507,同一爭戰同一標準﹐
19508,同一向神求相親。
19509,同一喜樂中的氣氛﹐
19510,在於永遠的岸前﹔
19511,在彼惟一全能的神﹐
19512,掌權愛中至永遠。
19513,應當前進﹐旅客弟兄﹐
19514,前進倚著十字架﹔
19515,忍受羞辱﹐受它貧窮﹐
19516,直到休息它蔭下。
19517,不久墳墓都要裂開﹐
19518,不久死者要醒來﹐
19519,所有陰影都要失在﹐
19520,最終生命滿情愛。
19569,"Jesus! engrave it on my heart,"
19570,That Thou the One thing needful art;
19571,"I could from all things part-ed be,"
19572,"But never, never, Lord, from Thee!"
19573,求主耶穌銘刻我心；
19574,惟祢是我所需、所親。
19575,地上萬事均可仳離，
19576,但我永遠不能離祢。
19577,Jesus and shall it ever be?
19578,A mortal man ashamed of Thee?
19579,"Ashamed of Thee, Whom angels praise,"
19580,Whose glories shine thro' endless days?
19581,Ashamed of Jesus! Sooner far
19582,Let night disown each radiant star;
19583,"'Tis midnight with my soul, till He,"
19584,"Bright Morning Star, bid darkness flee."
19585,Ashamed of Jesus! O as soon
19586,Let morning blush to own the sun;
19587,"He sheds the beams of light divine,"
19588,O'er this benighted soul of mine.
19589,Ashamed of Jesus! That dear friend
19590,On whom my hopes of heav'n depend?
19591,"No, when I blush, be this my shame,"
19592,That I no more revere His Name.
19593,Till then — nor is the boasting vain
19594,"Till then, I boast a Saviour slain;"
19595,"And, O may this my glory be,"
19596,That Christ is not ashamed of me.
19597,耶穌，到底是否可能？
19598,竟然有人羞認祢名？
19599,天使所頌榮耀光輝，
19600,竟會有人羞認祢名！
19601,竟然有人羞認主名，
19602,無異黑夜羞認明星！
19603,我心本來就是夜央，
19604,祢為晨星使黑變明。
19605,無異清晨羞認朝陽！
19606,主是朝陽光華四射，
19607,照明我的如夜天良。
19608,我們上天希望所寄；
19609,我心慚愧我臉含羞，
19610,因我不認祢名無比。
19611,直到那日，我心所誇，
19612,仍是救主為我受死；
19613,這是我的永遠榮耀，
19614,基督竟不以我為恥。
19669,"There is one thing, O Lord!"
19670,There is one thing I desire of Thee;
19671,"There is one thing, like David:"
19672,That I may dwell in the house of the Lord
19673,"All the days of my life, All the days of my life,"
19674,"To behold the beauty of the Lord,"
19675,And to inquire in His temple.
19676,"There is one thing, O Lord,"
19677,There is one thing like Mary:
19678,That I may sit at the feet of the Lord
19679,"Just to hear His word and feel His heart,"
19680,I want to choose that better part.
19681,There is one thing like Paul:
19682,"That I forget what lies behind,"
19683,"Reaching for what's ahead, Reaching for what's ahead,"
19684,I will press toward the mark for the prize
19685,Of the high calling of God in Christ.
19686,只有一事，我主，
19687,只有一事，我心稱羨–
19688,只有一事如大衛：
19689,我只尋求能居住在祢殿，
19690,在我一生之久，在我一生之久，
19691,讓我瞻仰主祢的榮美，
19692,並讓我求問祢你殿內。
19693,只有一事如馬利亞：
19694,我只尋求能安坐祢腳前，
19695,讓我聆聽主恩言意深，
19696,我要揀選這上好福分。
19697,只有一事如保羅：
19698,我要忘記背後努力面前，
19699,向著標竿直奔，向著標竿直奔，
19700,要得神在基督耶穌裡
19701,從上召我來得的獎賞。
19702,"More like the Master I would ever be,"
19703,"More of His meekness, more humility;"
19704,"More zeal to labor, more courage to be true,"
19705,More consecration for work He bids me do.
19706,"Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone;"
19707,"Take Thou my heart, and make it all Thine own;"
19708,"Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,"
19709,Wash me and keep me Thine forever more.
19710,More like the Master is my daily prayer;
19711,More strength to carry crosses I must bear;
19712,More earnest effort to bring His kingdom in;
19713,"More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win."
19714,More like the Master I would live and grow;
19715,More of His love to others I would show;
19716,"More self-denial, like His in Galilee,"
19717,More like the Master I long to ever be.
19718,我要更像主，我天天追求，
19719,更像祂謙卑，更像祂溫柔；
19720,更熱心工作，更勇敢去救人，
19721,更多的奉獻去接受祂委任。
19722,接受我心，我只願意屬祢；
19723,接受我心，不要將我丟棄！
19724,聽我祈求，使我與罪隔離；
19725,洗我，保守我，永遠是為著祢。
19726,我要更像主，求天天賜下；
19727,更多的恩惠，來背我十架；
19728,更倚靠聖靈，去將浪子帶領；
19729,更多的努力，豫備國度到境。
19730,我要更像主，來活並來忍，
19731,更顯出祂愛，來對待別人，
19732,更多的捨己，像祂在加利利，
19733,我要更像主，這永是我心意。
19734,Deeper into the holy life-
19735,"O, what a rest from inward strife!"
19736,"Daily from self and sin be free,"
19737,Till I be wholly lost in Thee.
19738,更深進入聖潔生活：
19739,不再掙扎，何等安息！
19740,逐日脫離罪、己捆鎖，
19741,直到全人消失於祢。
19742,I've turned my back upon the world
19743,"With all its idle pleasures,"
19744,"And set my heart on better things,"
19745,On higher holier treasures;
19746,"No more its glitter and its glare,"
19747,And vanity shall blind me;
19748,"I've cross'd the separating line,"
19749,And left the world behind me.
19750,"Far, far behind me, Far, far behind me!"
19751,"I've left the old sad life of sin,"
19752,Its follies all forsaken;
19753,"My standing place is now in Christ,"
19754,His holy vows I've taken;
19755,Beneath the standard of the cross
19756,The world henceforth shall find me;
19757,"I've passed in Christ from death to life,"
19758,"Far, far behind me! Far, far behind me!"
19759,My soul shall ne'er return again
19760,"Back to its former station,"
19761,"For here alone is perfect peace,"
19762,And rest from condemnation;
19763,"I've made exchange of masters now,"
19764,"The vows of glory bind me,"
19765,"And once for all I've left the world,"
19766,"Yes, left the world behind me."
19767,"My choice is made forevermore,"
19768,I want no other Saviour;
19769,I ask no purer happiness
19770,Than His sweet love and favor;
19771,"My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,"
19772,No more the world shall blind me;
19773,"I've crossed the Red Sea of His death,"
19774,我今轉身背向俗世，
19775,和它一切的歡娛；
19776,我今心向更美的事，
19777,就是天上的儲蓄。
19778,一切寶貝，一切榮顯，
19779,不能使我再逗遛；
19780,我今越過分別界線，
19781,世界丟棄在背後。
19782,遠遠在背後，遠遠在背後，
19783,我今脫離罪的生活，
19784,棄絕所有的愚行；
19785,我今接受主的領率，
19786,願意聽祂的命令。
19787,我既靠主免為死囚，
19788,主今作我的元首；
19789,我願為祂捨去所有，
19790,我今永遠不再返回，
19791,舊日愚昧的境地；
19792,惟獨在此纔不定罪，
19793,在此纔會有安息。
19794,我今已經更換主人，
19795,對祂，我要永伺候；
19796,地的捆綁就此脫盡，
19797,我的前途一定永定，
19798,我並不要別救主；
19799,我也不求更好福音，
19800,過於祂賜的寬恕。
19801,我心已經決定事神，
19802,無論如何不回頭，
19803,已往一切實為可恨，
19804,"From glory to glory He's changing me,"
19805,"Changing me, changing me;"
19806,"His likeness and image to perfect in me,"
19807,The love of God shown to the world.
19808,"For He's changing, changing me,"
19809,"From earthly things to the heavenly,"
19810,主榮上加榮正在改變我，
19811,改變我，改變我。
19812,使我得完全變成主的形像，
19813,流露神大愛在世間。
19814,主在改變，改變我，
19815,使屬地形像變成屬天，
19848,"Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing"
19849,My great Redeemer's praise;
19850,"The glories of my God and King,"
19851,The triumphs of His grace!
19852,"My gracious Master and my God,"
19853,Assist me to proclaim
19854,To spread through all the earth abroad
19855,The honours of Thy Name.
19856,"Jesus, The name that charms our fears,"
19857,That bids our sorrows cease!
19858,"'Tis music in the sinner's ears,"
19859,"'Tis life, and health, and peace."
19860,"He breaks the power of cancelled sin,"
19861,He sets the prisoner free;
19862,"His blood can make the foulest clean,"
19863,His blood avails for me.
19864,"His love my heart has captive made,"
19865,"His captive would I be,"
19866,"For He was bound, and scourged and died,"
19867,My captive soul to free.
19868,"So now Thy blessed Name I love,"
19869,"Thy will would ever be mine,"
19870,"My Lord, they all were Thine!"
19871,哦﹐願我有千萬舌頭﹐
19872,前來讚美救主﹔
19873,說祂恩典何等深厚﹐
19874,榮耀何等豐富。
19875,耶穌這名﹐慰我心情﹐
19876,驅盡我的驚怯﹔
19877,是我安息﹐是我生命﹐
19878,成為我的音樂。
19879,祂因愛我﹐竟願經歷
19880,人世所有苦楚﹔
19881,打破罪的捆綁能力﹐
19882,釋放罪的囚徒。
19883,我每靜念救我的愛﹐
19884,立即感覺不配﹔
19885,不知祂為甚麼恩待
19886,我這人中罪魁。
19887,我今作祂愛的俘虜﹐
19888,甘心作到永久﹔
19889,因祂為我受死、受辱﹐
19890,使我得以自由。
19891,我既從祢可愛的名﹐
19892,知祢待我美意﹔
19893,假若我有千萬的心﹐
19894,也當一一歸祢。
19895,我今所知主恩有限，我雖也曾瞥見主臉；
19896,等我與祂美地相見，對祂認識纔能完全。
19897,那時我必完全知道，像主對我一樣明瞭；
19898,那時我必親見主面，在祂座前頌讚無間。
19899,我今所知主愛有限，雖有明光照我心間；
19900,更有榮耀極重無比，就要光照十分明晰。
19901,我今所能明白有限，父手如何帶領向前；
19902,等我一到光明的家，就知祂路極妙絕佳。
19903,今雖有限，但何甘甜，因信安息在祂腳前；
19904,今雖彷彿對鏡觀看，帕子一去，陰影全散。
19905,"Keep on believing, Jesus is near,"
19906,"Keep on believing, there's nothing to fear."
19907,"Keep on believing, this is the way,"
19908,Faith in the night as well as the day.
19909,不斷信靠主，祂正親近；
19910,不斷信靠主，無驚懼可侵。
19911,不斷信靠主，沿此路走；
19912,信心在夜裹，如在白晝。
19913,"God said it, and I believe it; That settles it,"
19914,"So I proclaim it. He cannot fail,"
19915,Nor can He ever lie; What a faithful God have I.
19916,神說話，我就相信祂；既是如此，
19917,我宣告祂話。祂無謊言，
19918,也從不誤事；祂是何等的信實。
19919,"Crucified with Christ my Saviour, to the world and self and sin;"
19920,To the death-born life of Jesus I am sweetly ent'ring in;
19921,"In His fellowship of suff'ring, to His death conformed to be,"
19922,I am going with my Saviour all the way to Calvary.
19923,"All the way to Calvary, where my Saviour went for me,"
19924,"Help me, Lord, to go with Thee all the way to Calvary."
19925,'Tis not hard to die with Jesus when His risen life we know;
19926,'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings when our hearts with joy o'erflow.
19927,"In His resurrection power He has come to dwell in me,"
19928,And my heart is gladly going all the way to Calvary.
19929,"If we die we'll live with Jesus, if we suffer we shall reign;"
19930,Only thus the prize of glory can the conqueror attain.
19931,"Oh, how sweet on that glad morning should the Master say to thee,"
19932,"""Yes, My child, thou didst go with Me all the way to Calvary."""
19933,我已與基督同釘死﹐脫自己、罪惡、俗世﹔
19934,所以我能平安接領主從死得生的命。
19935,我甘願和祂同受苦﹐效法祂至死順服﹔
19936,我願跟我救主耶穌直走十字架的路。
19937,一直走十架窄路﹗主是受死在那裏﹗
19938,求主使我能同祢一直走十架窄路﹗
19939,我何難與基督同死﹐因復活﹐我已認識﹔
19940,我何難與基督同苦﹐因神旨﹐我願順服。
19941,主藉著復活的能力﹐今居住在我靈裏﹔
19942,因此﹐我歡樂著舉足﹐直走十字架的路。
19943,同主死﹐就必同主生﹐同受苦﹐必同高升﹔
19944,得勝者惟獨照這樣﹐纔能蒙基督獎賞。
19945,真可樂﹗若在那早晨﹐你聽主對你發聲﹐
19946,以為你曾忠心順服-一直走十字架的路﹗
19984,God be with you till we meet again;
19985,"By His counsels guide, uphold you, with His sheep securely fold you,"
19986,God be with you till we meet again.
19987,"Till we meet, till we meet, till we meet at Jesus' feet;"
19988,"Till we meet, till we meet, God be with you till we meet again."
19989,"'Neath His wings securely hide you, daily manna still provide you;"
19990,God be with you till we meet again!
19991,"When life's perils thick confound you, put His arms unfailing round you;"
19992,"Keep love's banner floating o'er you, smite death's threat'ning wave before you;"
19993,願神同在直至再見面﹗
19994,照祂美意來引導你﹐用祂羊圈來護圍你﹐
19995,再見面﹐再見面﹐再見面在主腳前﹗
19996,再見面﹐再見面﹐願主同在直至再見面﹗
19997,用祂翅膀常覆庇你﹐將祂嗎哪常供給你﹔
19998,每逢患難來攪擾你﹐祂用能手來懷抱你﹔
19999,以愛為旗常遮蓋你﹐死亡寒波不危害你﹔
20000,"Hear the footsteps of Jesus — He is now passing by,"
20001,"Bearing balm for the wounded, healing all who apply;"
20002,"As He spake to the suff'rer who lay at the pool,"
20003,"He is saying this moment, ""Wilt thou be made whole?"""
20004,Wilt thou be made whole? Wilt thou be made whole?
20005,"Oh, come, weary suff'rer, Oh, come, sin-sick soul;"
20006,"See the life-stream is flowing, See the cleansing waves roll;"
20007,Step into the current and thou shalt be whole.
20008,"'Tis the voice of that Saviour, whose merciful call"
20009,Freely offers salvation to one and to all;
20010,He is now beck'ning to Him each sin-tainted soul
20011,"And lovingly asking, ""Wilt thou be made whole?"""
20012,"Are you halting and struggling, overpow'red by your sin,"
20013,"While the waters are troubled, can you not enter in?"
20014,"Lo, the Saviour stands waiting to strengthen your soul;"
20015,"He is earnestly pleading, ""Wilt thou be made whole?"""
20016,"Blessed Saviour, assist us to rest on Thy Word;"
20017,Let the soul-healing power on us now be outpoured;
20018,"Wash away every sin spot, take perfect control,"
20019,"Say to each trusting spirit, ""Thy faith makes thee whole."""
20020,請聽﹗耶穌腳步聲﹐祂正從此經過﹐
20021,為傷者祂帶膏油﹐醫治所有軟弱﹔
20022,正如祂曾見病者﹐在池邊躺臥﹐
20023,"此刻祂正柔聲問﹕""你要痊愈麼﹖"""
20024,你要痊愈麼﹖你要痊愈麼﹖
20025,來吧﹗被罪苦害者﹐多年軟弱﹔
20026,看哪﹗生命泉已開﹐醫治活水湧流﹐
20027,快投身此泉﹐就必痊愈無憂。
20028,這是救主慈愛聲﹐滿帶憐憫呼召﹗
20029,祂要賜白白救恩﹐只要你肯求告﹔
20030,祂正召呼眾罪人﹐就祂脫罪鎖﹐
20031,"此刻祂正慈聲問﹕""你要痊愈麼﹖"""
20032,是否在猶豫、掙扎﹐被罪欺壓痛苦﹖
20033,正當池中水動時﹐是否無法投入﹖
20034,看哪﹗救主在等待救你脫軟弱﹐
20035,"此刻祂正迫切問﹕""你要痊愈麼﹖"""
20036,可頌救主﹐求助我﹐在祢話裏安息﹗
20037,好讓祢能在我身傾倒醫治能力﹔
20038,願祢掌管我全人﹐罪污求洗去﹐
20039,"並對我說﹕""你信心已叫你痊愈﹗"""
20040,"Just one touch as He moves along,"
20041,"Push'd and press'd by the jostling throng,"
20042,"Just one touch and the weak was strong,"
20043,Cured by the Healer divine.
20044,"Just one touch as He passes by,"
20045,He will list to the faintest cry.
20046,"Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,"
20047,Christ is the Healer divine.
20048,"Just one touch! and He makes me whole,"
20049,"Speaks sweet peace to my sin-sick soul,"
20050,"At His feet all my burdens roll,"
20051,"Just one touch! and the work is done,"
20052,"I am cured by the blessed Son,"
20053,"I will sing while the ages run,"
20054,"Just one touch! and He turns to me,"
20055,O the love in His eyes I see!
20056,"I am His for He hears my plea,"
20057,Just one touch! by His mighty power
20058,"He can heal thee this very hour,"
20059,Thou canst hear tho' the tempests low'r
20060,只一摸﹐當主正經過﹐
20061,眾人擁塞將祂擠著﹔
20062,她從背後將主一摸﹐
20063,立刻得著了痊愈。
20064,只一摸﹐就必得痊愈﹗
20065,主仍在此﹐尚未離去﹔
20066,前來摸祂﹐不必再疑慮﹐
20067,一摸就必得痊愈。
20068,只一摸﹐就必得痊愈﹐
20069,祂使我心平安無懼﹔
20070,在祂腳前﹐重擔全去﹐
20071,我已得著了痊愈。
20072,只一摸﹐一切卻完成﹐
20073,我得脫去所有疾病﹔
20074,直到永遠﹐我要頌稱﹐
20075,因我得著了痊愈。
20076,只一摸﹐主就轉過來﹐
20077,哦﹐祂眼中希奇之愛﹔
20078,撫慰我心﹐使我感戴﹐
20079,只一摸﹐就必得醫治﹐
20080,祂能醫你﹐就在此時﹔
20081,只要一摸﹐不管病勢﹐
20082,就必得著了痊愈。
20083,Blessed be the glorious tidings to a suff'ring world revealed;
20084,"Jesus has atoned for sickness, and by His stripes we are healed."
20085,"Blessed be the great atonement, to a suff'ring world revealed;"
20086,"Blessed be the great Physician, for by His stripes we are healed."
20087,Jesus ever welcomed suff'rers to His mercy who appealed;
20088,"He bids us bring Him our sickness, for by His stripes we are healed."
20089,"Blessed be the sacred 'nointing, by the Holy Spirit sealed;"

20095,神的福音﹐何等有福﹗來救痛苦的人世﹔
20096,耶穌已為疾病救贖﹐祂的鞭傷有醫治。
20097,讚美救主完全救贖﹐來救痛苦的人世﹔
20098,讚美救主作我大夫﹐祂受鞭傷我得治。
20099,無論是誰求祂設法﹐祂都歡迎不推辭﹔
20100,祂叫我帶疾病尋祂﹐因祂鞭傷能醫治。
20101,讚美祂的神聖膏油﹐藉著聖靈來恩賜﹔
20102,求祢來為我們按手﹐因祢鞭傷能醫治。
20103,當那撒但火箭環攻﹐求作盾牌來抵制﹔
20104,我們必定安全到終﹐因祢鞭傷有醫治。
20105,主﹐我奉獻所有肢體﹐我要榮耀祢不止﹔
20106,使我不至有日忘記祢的鞭傷有醫治。
20107,"Life for the body thro' His blood, saved in our spirit, body, soul;"
20108,"Christ did not die to save a part, but has redeemed and claims the whole."
20109,"Take life from Jesus everyday, trust in His promise and obey;"
20110,"Receive His strength from day to day, praise Him thro'out our pilgrim way."
20111,"Life for the body thro' His word, that word which speaks in living pow'r;"
20112,"That word which form'd the worlds of space, can give to us new life each hour."
20113,"Life for the body from above, life thro' the Spirit's quick'ning breath;"
20114,Healed by the resurrection life that raised our blessed Lord from death.
20115,身體得生命﹐藉寶血﹐我靈﹐與魂﹐與體得贖﹔
20116,基督不止只救一節﹐祂是來救我的全部。
20117,每天從主吸取生命﹐相信應許遵祂命令﹔
20118,日過一日﹐從祂得力﹐完我旅程﹐讚美不已。
20119,身體得生命﹐藉話語﹐它是充滿神聖能力﹔
20120,它曾創造許多世宇﹐每刻都能生命供給。
20121,身體得生命﹐藉聖靈﹐是祂每時向我吹氣﹔
20122,是祂來作復活生命﹐是祂使主從死復起。
20123,"He healeth me, O bless His name! I want to spread abroad His fame;"
20124,"From dread disease He sets me free, the Lord my healer, strong is He."
20125,"He healeth me, He healeth me, by pow'r divine He healeth me;"
20126,"He healed the sick in Galilee, and now by faith He healeth me."
20127,"He healeth me, my simple faith believes the word that Jesus saith."
20128,"And takes the place of ardent hope, believes the Lord will raise me up."
20129,"He healeth me, I touch for cure the border of His garment pure,"
20130,"And virtue through my being flows, a healing balm for nature's woes."
20131,"He healeth me, as when of yore, their sins and sicknesses He bore,"
20132,"Nor has He lost His pow'r and skill, our blessed Christ is living still."
20133,"He healeth me, O oft I sought this healing pow'r but found it not,"
20134,"But now I trust with all my soul, and now thro' faith He makes me whole."
20135,祂醫治我﹐讚美祂名﹗我要歌頌祂的救贖﹔
20136,祂釋放我脫離疾病﹐大能的主是我大夫。
20137,祂醫治我﹐祂醫治我﹐祂有權柄來醫治我﹔
20138,祂在加利利已救活許多的人﹐今醫治我。
20139,祂醫治我﹐信心簡單﹐滿心相信祂說的話﹔
20140,滿懷希望﹐滿載平安﹐我信祂必使我離榻。
20141,祂醫治我﹐我求醫治﹐來摸祂的衣裳襚子﹔
20142,能力流通全身不止﹐自然沉坷受了禁制。
20143,祂醫治我﹐有如當日﹐祂來擔當疾病罪過﹔
20144,祂並不失祂的本事﹐我的救主仍然活著。
20145,祂醫治我﹐我已求尋許多次數﹐但不得著﹔
20146,但今我是全心相信﹐因信﹐祂今使我再活。
20147,Asleep in Jesus! Blessed sleep!
20148,From which none ever wakes to weep.
20149,"A calm and undisturbed repose,"
20150,Unbroken by the last of foes.
20151,Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet
20152,To be for such a slumber meet;
20153,With holy confidence to sing
20154,That death hath lost its painful sting!
20155,Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest!
20156,Whose waking is supremely blest;
20157,"No fear, no woe shall dim that hour"
20158,That manifests the Saviour's pow'r.
20159,Asleep in Jesus! O for me
20160,May such a blissful refuge be!
20161,"Securely shall my ashes lie,"
20162,Waiting the summons from on high.
20163,Asleep in Jesus! Far from thee
20164,Thy kindred and their graves may be;
20165,"But there is still a blessed sleep,"
20166,主裏安睡﹐何等有福﹗
20167,此睡﹐無人醒來哭泣﹔
20168,脫離紛擾﹐進入安舒﹐
20169,仇敵權勢無法攻擊。
20170,主裏安睡﹐何等甘甜﹗
20171,此睡﹐無人仍帶苦憂﹔
20172,信心堅定﹐唱出美言﹕
20173,死亡已失它的毒鉤。
20174,主裏安睡﹐何等安息﹗
20175,醒來﹐就是福氣無極﹔
20176,無懼、無苦再能掩蔽
20177,救主所要彰顯能力。
20178,主裏安睡﹐何等安穩﹗
20179,此避難所安全可靠﹔
20180,我的塵土安靜在等
20181,主自高天向我呼召。
20182,主裏安睡﹐暫時別離﹐
20183,醒後相聚﹐倍加欣喜﹔
20184,主裏安睡﹐福樂無比﹗
20185,此睡﹐無人醒來哭泣。
20186,This body in the grave we lay
20187,There to await that solemn day
20188,When God Himself shall bid it rise
20189,To mount triumphant to the sky.
20190,"All trials and all griefs are past,"
20191,A blessed end has come at last.
20192,Christ's yoke was borne with ready will;
20193,Who dieth thus is living still.
20194,We have no cause to mourn or weep;
20195,Securely shall this body sleep
20196,Till Christ Himself shall death destroy
20197,And raise the blessed dead to joy.
20198,For they who with Him suffered here
20199,Shall there be healed from woe and fear;
20200,"And when eternal bliss is won,"
20201,They'll shine in glory like the sun.
20202,Then let us leave this place of rest
20203,"And homeward turn, for they are blest"
20204,Who heed God's warning and prepare
20205,Lest death should find them unaware.
20206,今將此身安葬入墓﹐
20207,安息等候大日臨到﹔
20208,神必親自叫它復甦﹐
20209,凱旋上升喜樂歡跳。
20210,一切煩惱、試煉皆過﹐
20211,盡已終結葬此土下﹔
20212,凡曾在世甘負主軛﹐
20213,雖死猶生﹐仍舊說話。
20214,我們不用傷心流淚﹐
20215,如此安眠﹐何等有福﹗
20216,等主再臨﹐死亡摧毀﹐
20217,必再醒來﹐喜樂歡呼﹗
20218,在世與主同受苦難﹐
20219,在天必要同享榮耀﹔
20220,在那永遠福樂彼岸﹐
20221,光明如日榮耀四照。
20222,今讓我們就此告別﹐
20223,勇奔前程﹐豫備不懈﹔
20224,因信迎接死亡無怯﹐
20225,待繞主前歡聚永偕。

20249,See Israel's gentle Shepherd stand
20250,With all engaging charms;

20252,And folds them in His arms!
20253,"""Permit them to approach,"" He cries,"
20254,"""Nor scorn their humble name;"

20261,看哪﹗慈愛牧者站立﹐
20262,充滿柔和笑容﹔
20263,聽哪﹗祂在呼喚小羊﹐
20264,緊抱在祂懷中。
20265,"""不要輕視小羊微弱﹐"
20266,讓他們親近我﹔
20267,正為祝福如此弱群﹐
20268,"我來地上生活。"""
20269,我們舉起感恩的手﹐
20270,將兒女獻於祢﹔
20271,何等喜樂﹐我們屬祢﹐

20297,"Have you read the story of the Cross, where Jesus bled and died,"
20298,Where your debt was paid by His precious blood that flowed from His wounded side?

20300,"Upon a tree, for you, for me, He died of a broken heart."

20315,Some day He's coming back — what glory that will be!
20316,Wonderful His love to me!
20317,因為神愛世人﹐捨了獨生愛子﹔
20318,釘死在十架上﹐使我脫離罪勢。
20319,有日﹐祂要再來﹐何等尊貴榮耀﹗
20320,主的大愛真奇妙﹗
20321,"Look to the Lamb of God,"
20322,"For He alone is able to save you,"
20323,Look to the Lamb of God.
20324,仰望真神羔羊﹗

20348,不久我們升到天上﹐就要看見這耶穌﹔
20349,環繞寶座敬拜歌唱至高聖名主耶穌。
20350,"True-hearted, whole-hearted, faithful and loyal,"
20351,King of our lives by Thy grace we will be;

20366,要全心﹐要真心﹐信實且忠誠﹐
20367,惟靠祢恩典﹐生命的君王﹔
20368,因著祢能力﹐在輝煌旌旗下﹐
20369,奮發且剛強﹐全力赴戰場。

20382,"Charge, soldiers, charge in battle! The conflict has begun;"
20383,"Thy battle song triumphant ""The victory is won!"""
20384,Hell's power must be vanquished and Satan's forces strewn:
20385,The Captain of the Army will come and triumph soon.
20386,"Charge, soldiers, charge in battle! And gaze upon thy Lord;"
20387,"If thou wilt fight His battle, the throne is thy reward."
20388,"This war is of the spirit, not fought on earthly ground;"
20389,"The Lord well knows the foe is near, encircling us around."

20391,His resurrection power will lift thy spirit free.
20392,"Through Him thou wilt have power, the foe to battle down;"
20393,Through Him thou wilt the triumph sing and wear the victor's crown.
20394,"Charge, soldiers, charge in battle! Thou shalt ascend the throne;"
20395,"A feast He is preparing, how happy thou to own."
20396,With Him we're resurrected above the battle din;
20397,"Transcending all that binds us, we're far above in Him."
20398,"Charge, soldiers, charge in battle! Thou art the royal heir;"
20399,"The Lord from dust did choose thee, that thou His kingdom share."
20400,"Thou hast no part in darkness, Thy future, O how bright;"
20401,With Christ to dwell forever and in His love delight.
20402,With joyful shouts charge forward! The kingdom is before;
20403,"Upon the peak of Zion we'll sing, the battle o'er."
20404,The Lamb has won the victory! The Lamb is on the throne!
20405,"With shouts of joy we praise Him, for He must overcome."
20406,衝過！戰士哪﹐衝過！前線正在開火﹔
20407,但各各他已得勝﹐請你常唱此歌。
20408,黑暗權勢應當退！撒但陰府已危！
20409,萬軍之主的元帥﹐快要奏凱歸回。
20410,衝過！戰士哪﹐衝過！仰起你頭看我﹔
20411,你若為我打勝仗﹐必得登我寶座。
20412,這是屬靈的交戰﹐不在屬世地場﹔
20413,主已知道仇敵迫﹐前後四圍佈滿！
20414,衝過！戰士哪﹐衝過！你要登我寶座﹔
20415,使我復活的能力﹐會使你靈超脫。
20416,藉我﹐你要得權能﹐藉我﹐你要得勝﹔
20417,藉我﹐你要唱凱歌﹐藉我﹐你要高升。
20418,我已為你留一席﹐你要歡喜快樂。
20419,我們與祂同復活﹐與祂天上同坐﹔
20420,遠離戰場的喊聲﹐遠離綁人罪惡。
20421,衝過！戰士哪﹐衝過！你要登主寶座﹔
20422,主從灰塵揀選你﹐要你同祂得國。
20423,你的將來乃光明﹐不是黑暗灰心﹐
20424,永與耶穌在一起﹐永得祂的愛情。
20425,衝過！歡呼著衝過！前面就是寶座﹔
20426,你從郇山的高峰﹐可唱得勝新歌。
20427,被殺羔羊已得勝﹐登基羔羊已勝﹔
20428,我們歡呼讚美祂﹐因祂必定得勝。
20429,"The name of Jesus is our stand, it is our victory;"
20430,"Not on ourselves do we rely, but mighty Lord on Thee."
20431,"Our weapons are not arms of flesh, but ours the Spirit's sword,"
20432,"And God's whole armor putting on, we battle in the Lord."
20433,"Behold, the foe doth meet and plot, stand firm in one accord!"
20434,"Tho' war be fierce and darkness thick, resist him in the Lord!"
20435,"If one thro' fear should backward turn, He undermines the rest."
20436,"Oh, do not let your brothers down, nor by you be distressed."
20437,"The devil knows his time is short, He is the more enraged,"
20438,And by his wiles would weaken us before the battle's waged.
20439,"The trials now more numerous are, the suff'ring e'en more sore,"
20440,The force of hell opposing us more dreadful than before.
20441,What should our posture be today in such a desp'rate hour?
20442,Should we our ease and pleasure seek and let the foe devour?
20443,"Or with increasing conflict strong, courageous to endure?"
20444,'Tis here that life or death is won! Who will God's praise secure?
20445,"For Christ the Lord we then would stand, He is the Conqueror!"
20446,For Him we would endure the pain until the fight is o'er.
20447,The hour of triumph soon we'll see — the Lord will come again!
20448,"If now we suffer for His sake, then we with Him shall reign."
20449,當奉耶穌這名站住﹐信祂得勝站住﹔
20450,不靠自己力量站住﹐不靠才能站住。
20451,不要使用血氣兵器﹐只用聖靈寶劍﹔
20452,穿上神的軍裝服役﹐滅盡仇敵火箭。
20453,看哪﹐邪靈正在聚集﹐故當守你地場﹔
20454,四面黑暗﹐爭戰緊急﹐故當靠主抵擋。
20455,你若退後﹐怕仇敵兇﹐一人牽動全軍﹔
20456,請你不要使你弟兄因你緣故受窘。
20457,撒但已知其時不久﹐所以其氣忿忿﹔
20458,要在爭戰尚未起首﹐就使你靈鬱悶。
20459,誘惑、試探比前更多﹐苦難比前更大﹔
20460,陰府權勢攻逼你我﹐比前更為可怕。
20461,對此情形﹐我們當有何種態度纔可﹖
20462,我們可否因貪優游﹐便讓仇敵宰割﹖
20463,或者因著苦難加倍﹐更加忍耐奮勇﹖
20464,生死關頭﹐在此定規誰要得主稱榮﹖
20465,因此﹐你當為主站住﹐耶穌是得勝者﹔
20466,你當忍受一切痛苦﹐直到那日方捨。
20467,耶穌不久快要再臨﹐戰事不久要停﹔
20468,你今為主受難受驚﹐那日必得權柄。
20469,"Jesus, with Thy Church abide, be her Saviour, Lord and Guide,"

20475,"May she one in doctrine be, one in truth and charity,"
20476,"Winning all to faith in Thee: we beseech Thee, hear us."
20477,"May her scattered children be from reproach of evil free,"
20478,"Blameless witnesses for Thee: we beseech Thee, hear us."
20479,"May her lamp of truth be bright, bid her bear aloft its light"
20480,"Through the realms of heathen night: we beseech Thee, hear us."
20481,"May she soon all glorious be, spotless and from wrinkle free,"
20482,"Pure, and bright, and worthy Thee: we beseech Thee, hear us."
20483,求主住在教會中﹐顯出愛心的交通﹐
20484,求祢引導並感動﹐求聽我們禱告！
20485,賜她純正的話語﹐賜她屬靈的興趣﹐

20497,"Around Thy grave, Lord Jesus, in spirit here we stand,"
20498,With hearts all full of praises to keep Thy blest command;
20499,"Our souls by faith rejoicing, to trace Thy path of love,"
20500,"Down through death's angry billows, up to the throne above."
20501,"Lord Jesus! we remember the travail of Thy soul,"
20502,"When through Thy love's deep pity, the waves did o'er Thee roll;"
20503,"Baptized in death's dark waters, for us thy blood was shed;"
20504,"For us Thou, Lord of Glory, wast numbered with the dead."
20505,"O Lord! Thou now art risen, Thy travail all is o'er;"
20506,"For sin Thou once hast suffered, thou liv'st to die no more;"
20507,"Sin, death and hell are vanquished by Thee, the Church's Head;"
20508,"And lo! We share Thy triumphs, thou first-born from the dead."
20509,"Unto Thy death baptized, we own with Thee we died;"
20510,"With Thee, our Life, we're risen, and shall be glorified."
20511,"From sin, the world, and Satan, we're ransomed by Thy blood,"
20512,"And here would walk as strangers, alive with Thee to go."
20513,主耶穌﹐我們聚集在祢墓的四圍﹐
20514,口中歌唱心歡喜﹐見證祢的作為﹔
20515,我們用信來跟隨﹐追蹤祢的道路﹐
20516,藉這莊嚴奧妙水﹐進入祢的工夫。
20517,主耶穌﹐我們記念祢魂中的苦難﹐
20518,祢因向我施恩典﹐曾被波浪沖漫﹔
20519,為我﹐祢浸死水中﹐為我﹐祢曾流血﹐
20520,為我﹐祢曾離天庭﹐為我﹐祢曾命絕。
20521,哦﹐主﹐祢今已復活﹐黑暗已成往事﹐
20522,現今祢已登寶座﹐活著﹐永不再死﹔
20523,罪、死、陰府祢毀盡﹐我也同祢得勝﹐
20524,因祢是我的生命﹐我是坐享其成。
20525,我今受浸歸祢死！承認與祢同釘﹐
20526,我也與祢同復活﹐與祢榮耀有分﹔
20527,撒但、世界和罪惡﹐今都不能摸我﹐
20528,我今同祢作旅客﹐同祢為神生活。
20529,"Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too;"
20530,What is then left for me to do?
20531,Simply to cease from struggling and strife;
20532,Simply to walk in newness of life.
20533,Glory be to God.
20534,"Risen with Christ, my glorious Head,"
20535,"Holiness now, the pathway I tread,"
20536,"Beautiful thought, while walking therein;"
20537,He that is dead is freed from sin.
20538,"Living with Christ, who dieth no more,"
20539,"Following Christ, who goeth before,"
20540,"I am from bondage utterly freed,"
20541,Reckoning self as dead indeed.
20542,"Living for Christ, my members I yield,"
20543,"Servants to God, for evermore sealed,"
20544,"Not under law, I'm now under grace,"
20545,"Sin is dethroned, and Christ takes its place."
20546,"Growing in Christ, no more shall be named"
20547,"Things of which now I'm truly ashamed,"
20548,"Fruit unto holiness will I bear,"
20549,"Life evermore, the end I shall share."
20550,與主同葬﹐也一同復活﹐
20551,還有甚麼留給我去作﹖
20552,只要我不再奮鬥擊空﹐
20553,只要我照新生而舉動。
20554,榮耀歸於神！
20555,一同復活與我的元首﹐
20556,我今在聖潔路上行走﹔
20557,當我向前時﹐我就想到﹕
20558,"""死的人脫罪""是何其好！"
20559,與主同活﹐祂永不再死﹐
20560,與主同行﹐祂永不會遲﹔
20561,我天天算自己已經死﹐
20562,所以我就從捆綁得釋。
20563,為主活著﹐我獻上肢體﹐
20564,永遠歸神﹐作祂的奴隸﹔
20565,我今在恩下﹐不在法下﹐
20566,罪已失勢﹐主代興管轄。
20567,靠主長大﹐我今真慚愧
20568,再題到我的已往寶貴﹔
20569,我願意結出成聖果子﹐
20570,滿足神心意﹐遵行神旨。
20571,"For the bread and for the wine,"
20572,"For the pledge that seals Him mine,"
20573,"For the words of love divine,"
20574,"We give Thee thanks, O Lord."
20575,"Only bread and only wine,"
20576,"Yet to faith, the solemn sign"
20577,Of the heav'nly and divine!
20578,For the words that turn our eye
20579,"To the cross of Calvary,"
20580,"Bidding us in faith draw nigh,"
20581,For the words that fragrance breathe
20582,"These plain symbols underneath,"
20583,"Words that His own peace bequeath,"
20584,"For Thy words in Spirit shown,"
20585,"For Thy will to us made known,"
20586,"""Do ye this until I come,"""
20587,"Till He come we take the bread,"
20588,"Type of Him on whom we feed,"
20589,Him who liveth and was dead!
20590,Till He come we take the cup;
20591,"As we at His table sup,"
20592,Eye and heart are lifted up!
20593,"For that coming, here foreshown,"
20594,"For that day to man unknown,"
20595,"For the glory and the throne,"
20596,為著這餅和這杯﹐
20597,為著神子曾降卑﹐
20598,為著神恩如雨沛﹐
20599,主﹐我們感謝祢。
20600,依然是酒﹐依然餅﹐
20601,藉此信心卻看明﹕
20602,愛心神聖的小影。
20603,為著祢曾召我們﹐
20604,舉目仰望祢救恩﹐
20605,藉著信心近祢身﹐
20606,為著祢曾發命令﹐
20607,要我記念祢行徑—
20608,何等溫柔、何等貧！
20609,為著祢曾用慈愛﹐
20610,引我想家在天外—
20611,"""行此﹐直等到我來。"""
20612,直到祂來﹐我擘餅﹐
20613,表明祂作我生命﹐
20614,為我睡了﹐為我醒﹐
20615,直到祂來﹐我飲杯﹐
20616,表明祂賜福全備﹐
20617,使我站在新地位﹐
20618,為著再來的囑咐﹐
20619,為著那日的緊速﹐
20620,為著榮耀和國度﹐
20621,"Jesus spreads His banner o'er us, cheers our famished souls with food;"
20622,"He the banquet spreads before us, of His mystic flesh and blood."
20623,"Precious banquet, bread of heaven, wine of gladness, flowing free;"
20624,"May we taste it, kindly given, in remembrance Lord, of Thee."
20625,"In Thy holy incarnation, when the angels sang Thy birth;"
20626,"In Thy fasting and temptation, in Thy labors on the earth,"
20627,"In Thy trial and rejection, in Thy suff'rings on the tree,"
20628,"In Thy glorious resurrection, may we, Lord, remember Thee."
20629,主舉愛旗遮蓋我們﹐同來享受祂愛筵﹔
20630,我們感激救贖大恩﹐全心虔誠來記念。
20631,桌上陳設這餅和杯﹐都是表明祢的愛﹔
20632,我們一同領祢恩惠﹐我們一同來敬拜。
20633,我們記念祢曾臨世﹐成了奴僕歷艱苦﹔
20634,祢受試探﹐祢常禁食﹐勞碌並無枕首處。
20635,我們記念祢尋罪人﹐常受頂撞和饑渴﹔
20636,如有一人悔改歸神﹐祢認流血也值得。
20637,我們記念祢釘十架﹐被人定罪﹐被神棄﹔
20638,獨自支付我們贖價﹐祢顯祢愛的無極。
20639,我們記念祢今在天﹐在神右邊常代求﹔
20640,祢曾應許還要顯現﹐主阿﹐求祢快成就。
20641,"Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;"
20642,Here faith can touch and handle things unseen.
20643,"Here would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,"
20644,And all my weariness upon Thee lean.
20645,Here would I feed upon the bread of God;
20646,Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;
20647,Here would I lay aside each earthly load;
20648,Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.
20649,"Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness,"
20650,"Mine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing Blood;"
20651,"Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace:"
20652,"Thy blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord my God!"
20653,I have no help but Thine; nor do I need
20654,Another arm save Thine to lean upon;
20655,"It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;"
20656,"My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone."
20657,Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;
20658,"The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;"
20659,"The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,"
20660,Nearer than ever still our Shield and Sun.
20661,"Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,"
20662,"Yet passing, points to the glad feast above;"
20663,"Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,"
20664,The Lamb's great bridal-feast of bliss and love.
20665,"Behold! The cloud is taken up again,"
20666,Onward will march the faithful pilgrim band;
20667,"As Thou art calling, we will follow on,"
20668,Soon we will reach the city bright and grand.
20669,主﹐在此﹐我要與祢面對面﹐
20670,在此﹐我要用信把握不見﹔
20671,在此﹐我要更深認識恩典﹐
20672,將我疲勞都息在主腳前。
20673,在此﹐我要喫主所賜美物﹐
20674,在此﹐我要飲主所遞福杯﹔
20675,在此﹐我要忘記一切難處﹐
20676,再嘗一次赦罪平安滋味。
20677,我雖有罪﹐但祢卻有公義﹐
20678,我雖污穢﹐但祢卻有寶血﹔
20679,哦﹐主﹐祢的寶血﹐將我清洗﹐
20680,祢的公義﹐對付我的罪孽。
20681,除祢之外﹐我無別的幫助﹐
20682,有祢賜恩﹐我就不求人惠﹔
20683,有祢的愛﹐我已心滿意足﹐
20684,靠祢能力﹐我要站住地位。
20685,席撤何速﹐表記的物已盡﹐
20686,酒餅雖無﹐拯救的愛未亡﹔
20687,宴筵已過﹐祢仍在此親近﹐
20688,親近有加﹐作我萬有君王。
20689,上席﹐罷席﹐次次我們聚散﹐
20690,如此聚散﹐遙指天上佳筵﹔
20691,時雖未至﹐我們卻已豫嘗
20692,他日天上羔羊婚娶喜宴。
20693,看哪﹐雲柱今又離地上升﹐
20694,在這野地又要乘夜前征﹔
20695,祢正召呼﹐我們緊緊隨行﹐
20696,不久我們就到光明天城。
20697,"On that same night, Lord Jesus, when all around Thee joined"
20698,"To cast its darkest shadow across Thy holy mind,"
20699,"We hear Thy voice, blest Saviour, ""this do, remember me,"""
20700,"With grateful hearts responding, we do remember Thee."
20701,"The depth of all Thy suff'ring no heart could e'er conceive,"
20702,The cup of wrath o'erflowing for us Thou didst receive;
20703,"And, oh, of God forsaken on the accursed tree;"
20704,"With grateful hearts, Lord Jesus, we now remember Thee."
20705,"We think of all the darkness which round Thy spirit pressed,"
20706,"Of all those waves and billows, which rolled across Thy breast"
20707,"Oh, there Thy grace unbounded and perfect love we see;"
20708,"With joy and sorrow mingling, we would remember Thee."
20709,"We know Thee now as risen, the Firstborn from the dead;"
20710,"We see Thee now ascended, the Church's glorious Head."
20711,"In Thee by grace accepted, the heart and mind set free"
20712,"To think of all Thy sorrow, and thus remember Thee."
20713,"Till thou shalt come in glory, and call us hence away,"
20714,"To rest in all the brightness of that unclouded day,"
20715,"We show Thy death, Lord Jesus, and here would seek to be"
20716,"More to Thy death conformed, while we remember Thee."
20717,主耶穌﹐當那晚間﹐人們在祢旁邊﹐
20718,用盡黑暗和欺騙叫祢聖心受煎﹔
20719,祢在席間頻告語﹐要我行此相記﹐
20720,我們聽話今會聚﹐為的來記念祢。
20721,怒氣的杯何等苦！但祢為我們喝﹐
20722,死亡的浸何難渡！但祢為我們涉﹔
20723,可憐祢在髑髏地﹐竟被父神離棄﹐
20724,主﹐我們滿心感激﹐不能不記念祢。
20725,我想當日的幽冥﹐怎樣攻逼祢靈﹐
20726,又想洪濤和波瀾﹐怎樣漫過祢身﹔
20727,但在那裡我見祢﹐流露恩愛無比﹐
20728,主﹐我們憂喜交集﹐現在來記念祢。
20729,我們知祢已復活﹐吞滅死權死鉤﹐
20730,我們見祢坐寶座﹐作教會榮耀頭﹔
20731,我們因祢蒙悅納﹐身心因祢得醫﹐
20732,祢的恩典何浩大﹐怎能不記念祢？
20733,祢若尚未得榮來﹐接我免去大災﹐
20734,叫我與祢永同在﹐安息直到萬代﹔
20735,我們還要效法死﹐還要表明身體﹐
20736,還要想慕祢不止﹐還要來記念祢。
20737,"According to Thy gracious word,"
20738,"In meek humility,"
20739,"This will I do, my dying Lord,"
20740,I will remember Thee.
20741,"Thy body, broken for my sake,"
20742,My bread from heav'n shall be;
20743,"Thy testamental cup I take,"
20744,And thus remember Thee.
20745,Gethsemane can I forget?
20746,"Or there Thy conflict see,"
20747,"Thine agony and bloody sweat,"
20748,And not remember Thee?
20749,When to the cross I turn mine eyes
20750,"And rest on Calvary,"
20751,"O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,"
20752,I must remember Thee.
20753,Remember Thee and all Thy pains
20754,And all Thy love to me;
20755,"Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,"
20756,And when these failing lips grow dumb
20757,"And mind and memory flee,"
20758,"When Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come,"
20759,"Jesus, remember me."
20760,我們照祢恩惠話語﹐
20761,帶著謙卑心意﹐
20762,受死的主﹐我們會聚﹐
20763,現今來記念祢。
20764,祢的身體為我裂開﹐
20765,要成我的供給﹔
20766,我今舉起立約杯來﹐
20767,為的是記念祢。
20768,能否我忘客西馬尼﹐
20769,或看祢的孤寂﹐
20770,祢的血汗和祢哭泣﹐
20771,而不來記念祢。
20772,當我轉眼看十字架﹐
20773,看祢在髑髏地﹐
20774,神的羔羊﹐我的救法﹐
20775,我必須記念祢。
20776,記念祢和祢的苦痛﹐
20777,和祢對我愛意﹔
20778,一息尚存﹐一脈尚動﹐
20779,我必定記念祢。
20780,當我漸衰﹐嘴唇無音﹐
20781,思想記憶軟弱﹐
20782,當祢在祢國度降臨﹐
20783,主﹐求祢記念我。
20784,"Lord, hast Thou not one word for me?"
20785,"To bind my soul more close to Thee,"
20786,That ev'ry evil I may flee;
20787,"One word, O Lord! one word from Thee."
20788,"One word, to show how weak am I"
20789,"When in my strength alone I try,"
20790,"In vain I toil, in vain I sigh;"
20791,"One word, to show how near Thou art,"
20792,For thou dost dwell within my heart;
20793,And of Thy life I share a part;
20794,"One word of pow'r, oh, let me hear,"
20795,"Above the heart's most anxious fear,"
20796,"Thy still small voice, yet deep and clear;"
20797,"One word of final triumph, Lord;"
20798,"Sweet hope Thy promises afford,"
20799,To dwell with Thee in sweet accord;
20800,主﹐祢有否一句為我﹖
20801,使我更能向祢信託﹐
20802,使我更能離開己意﹔
20803,一句﹐我主﹐求賜一句。
20804,一句﹐來顯我的軟弱﹐
20805,當我欣賞自己工作﹐
20806,我空勞碌﹐我空歎息﹔
20807,一句﹐我主﹐求賜一句﹗
20808,一句﹐來示祢的相親﹐
20809,因祢乃是住在我心﹐
20810,祢的生命我也同領﹔
20811,一句﹐求將有力應許﹐
20812,顯在許多畏懼掛慮﹐
20813,祢的微聲﹐祢的話語﹔
20814,一句﹐最終得勝呼喊﹐
20815,得祢應許甘甜充滿﹐
20816,與祢永遠快樂同居﹔
20817,"Lord, in Thy presence we are met, a full salvation to proclaim,"
20818,"To testify of grace received, or offered now in Jesus' name;"
20819,"Dear Lord, to Thee our spirits cry, our ev'ry longing satisfy."
20820,"We ask Thee, Lord, for Thou art here, make this a Pentecostal hour,"
20821,"When hung'ring souls from Thee receive pardon, or purity, or pow'r;"
20822,"Unstop deaf ears, let blind eyes see, bring souls into Thy liberty."
20823,"Thou knowest sin-sick souls are here, sick with depravity within,"
20824,"Restless, discouraged, weary ones, and Thou art here to cleanse from sin;"
20825,"Oh, speak the word ""I will, be whole,"" and save and sanctify each soul."
20826,"Grant to Thy servants boldness now, that faithfully they speak Thy Word,"
20827,"By stretching forth Thy hand to heal, let signs and wonders from the Lord"
20828,"Here in our midst to-day be done. So, Father, glorify Thy Son."
20829,"We wait according to Thy Word, Lord, let it to Thy servants be;"
20830,"May nothing, self, pride, prejudice or unbelief, still hinder Thee;"
20831,"Bless'd Spirit, have unhindered way in yielded hearts and lives today."
20832,主阿﹐我們聚集祢前﹐要來傳說完全救法﹐
20833,使我見證所得恩典﹐並因祢名﹐望人接納﹔
20834,恩主﹐我靈向祢祈求﹐願祢將我羨慕成就。
20835,饑餓的心﹐從祢接受赦免、能力或是清潔﹐
20836,我求祢﹐主﹐使這時候成為又一的五旬節﹔
20837,開通耳聾﹐開明目盲﹐帶領靈魂得祢釋放。
20838,在此有人對罪厭煩﹐厭煩﹐因為裏面墮落﹐
20839,現今失望、疲倦、不安﹐而祢在此要除罪惡﹔
20840,"求祢說﹕""我肯﹐祢潔淨﹐""拯救、聖別每個生命。"
20841,賜祢僕人今有膽量﹐他們纔能忠心傳話﹔
20842,求祢伸手醫治病恙﹐神蹟奇事從祢出發﹔
20843,命其成在我們中間﹐求父將子如此榮顯。
20844,主﹐我等候祢的聖言﹐成功在祢僕人身上﹔
20845,不讓自己驕傲、成見﹐或是不信把祢阻擋﹔
20846,願祢聖靈自由開墾柔軟的心、降服的人。
20847,"Blessed Jesus, at Thy word we are gathered all to hear Thee;"
20848,Let our heart and soul be stirred now to seek and love and fear Thee;
20849,"By Thy teaching sweet and holy, drawn from earth to love Thee solely."
20850,"All our knowledge, sense, and sight lie in deepest darkness shrouded,"
20851,Till Thy Spirit breaks our night with the beams of truth unclouded.
20852,Thou alone to God canst win us; thou must work all good within us.
20853,"Glorious Lord, Thyself impart! Light of light, from God proceeding."
20854,"Open Thou our ears and heart. Help us by Thy Spirit's pleading,"
20855,"Hear the cry Thy people raises. Hear, and bless our pray'rs and praises."
20856,救主﹐我們因祢話﹐現在聚集要來靜聽﹔
20857,但願心都受溶化﹐要來敬畏並受引領﹔
20858,因祢教訓聖潔無此﹐吸引我們完全愛祢。
20859,我們知識和感覺﹐難免黑暗深重遮蔽﹔
20860,除非聖靈的光教﹐藉著真理深入啟迪﹔
20861,只有祢能帶我歸神﹐祢須作工在於我身。
20862,我主﹐求祢賜自己﹐從神出來光中之光﹔
20863,開通我耳並我意﹐以祢聖靈助我盼望﹔
20864,請聽祢的子民呼求﹐請聽﹐並請祝福不休。
20865,Blest be the tie that binds
20866,Our hearts in Christian love;
20867,The fellowship of kindred minds
20868,Is like to that above.
20869,Before our Father's throne
20870,We pour our ardent prayers;
20871,"Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,"
20872,Our comfort and our cares.
20873,"We share our mutual woes,"
20874,"Our mutual burdens bear,"
20875,And often for each other flows
20876,The sympathizing tear.
20877,"When we asunder part,"
20878,It gives us inward pain;
20879,"But we shall still be joined in heart,"
20880,And hope to meet again.
20881,"From sorrow, toil and pain,"
20882,And sin we shall be free;
20883,And perfect love and friendship reign
20884,Through all eternity.
20885,福哉﹐愛的捆綁﹐
20886,捆綁我們相契﹔
20887,同一的心彼此交往﹐
20888,就與天人無異。
20889,在父寶座之前﹐
20890,我們熱心祈求﹔
20891,有苦同咽﹐有望同勉﹐
20892,同心﹐同樂﹐同憂。
20893,軟弱彼此體諒﹐
20894,重擔互相擔當﹔
20895,一人心傷﹐眾人淚淌﹐
20896,只有一個心腸。
20897,每逢彼此分離﹐
20898,寸衷悵惘難言﹔
20899,但身雖離﹐心仍合一﹐
20900,希望再會眼前。
20901,盼望那日快顯﹐
20902,再無別離心酸﹔
20903,相愛更親﹐相交更甜﹐
20904,同樂直到永遠。
20905,"O prefect Love, all human thought transcending,"
20906,"Lowly we kneel in prayer before Thy throne,"
20907,"That theirs may be the love which knows no ending,"
20908,Whom Thou forevermore dost join in one.
20909,"O perfect Life, be Thou their full assurance"
20910,"Of tender charity and steadfast faith,"
20911,"Of patient hope, and quiet, brave endurance,"
20912,With childlike trust that fears nor pain nor death.
20913,"Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow,"
20914,"Grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,"
20915,"And to life's day the glorious, unknown morrow"
20916,That dawns upon eternal love and life.
20917,哦﹐完全的愛﹐遠超人心所想！
20918,在祢寶座前﹐我們同禱祈﹕
20919,願他們相愛﹐到永遠無限量﹐
20920,在主裏合而為一永相繫。
20921,哦﹐完全生命﹐願成他們確據﹕
20922,得著祢柔愛﹐不移的信心﹐
20923,單純的依靠如孩童無所懼﹐
20924,不息的盼望﹐無聲的堅忍。
20925,求賜祢喜樂﹐消除一切憂、怯﹐
20926,並賜祢平安﹐撫平諸爭競﹔
20927,願他們共度一生未知歲月﹐
20928,聯於這永遠的愛與生命。
20929,"O God of love to Thee we bow,"
20930,And pray for these before Thee now.
20931,"That, closely knit in holy vow,"
20932,They may in Thee be one.
20933,"When days are filled with pure delight,"
20934,"When paths are plain and skies are bright,"
20935,"Walking by faith and not by sight,"
20936,May they in Thee be one.
20937,"When stormy winds fulfill Thy will,"
20938,"And all their good seems turned to ill,"
20939,"Then, trusting Thee completely, still"
20940,Whate'er in life shall be their share
20941,"Of quick'ning joy or burd'ning care,"
20942,"In pow'r to do and grace to bear,"
20943,"Eternal Love, with them abide;"
20944,"In Thee forever may they hide,"
20945,For even death cannot divide
20946,Those whom Thou makest one.
20947,愛的神阿﹐在祢座前﹐
20948,我們今為新人禱祈﹔
20949,求使他們緊緊相聯﹐
20950,祢裏合而為一。
20951,有時道路平順無險﹐
20952,天色明麗﹐充滿歡喜﹔
20953,憑信前進不憑眼見﹐
20954,因在祢裏合一。
20955,有時遭遇狂風暴雨﹐
20956,一切福樂變為憂慼﹔
20957,全心靠主﹐一無畏懼﹐
20958,仍在祢裏合一。
20959,共度此生﹐不問禍福﹐
20960,同證主恩﹐不論憂喜﹔
20961,從主得力﹐堅忍相助﹐
20962,永在祢裏合一。
20963,永遠的愛﹐時刻同在﹐
20964,主裏躲藏﹐何等安息﹔
20965,即使死亡﹐不能分開﹐
20966,主所結合為一。

20997,Send the light! The blessed gospel light; let it shine from shore to shore!
20998,Send the light! The blessed gospel light; let it shine forevermore.
20999,"We have heard the Macedonian call today,"
21000,"And a golden off'ring at the cross we lay,"
21001,Let us pray that grace may everywhere abound;
21002,And a Christlike spirit everywhere be found
21003,"Let us not grow weary in the work of love,"
21004,"Let us gather jewels for a crown above,"
21005,有一呼聲來自幽禁的罪囚﹐
21006,"""來發光﹗來發光﹗"""
21007,千萬靈魂等待你我去拯救﹐
21008,去發光﹗去發光﹗
21009,去發光﹗去發福音真光﹗使這光普照四方﹗
21010,去發光﹗去發福音真光﹗使這光永遠輝煌﹗

21017,Teach us to pray that we can cause
21018,"The enemy to flee,"
21019,That we his evil pow'r may bind
21020,His prisoners to free.
21021,Teach us to pray and firmly stand
21022,"Upon the battleground,"
21023,"To fight and break the stronghold down,"

21033,求主教我如何禱告﹗
21034,如何使敵遁逃﹔
21035,如何捆綁滅其權勢﹐
21036,使眾罪囚得釋。
21037,如何陣地站牢﹔
21038,如何奮進攻破營壘﹐
21039,立使仇敵潰退。
21040,明白神的最好﹔
21041,如何禱告搖動天地﹐
21042,得著血下權利。
21043,因著信心﹐藉著禱告﹐
21044,學習與主同勞﹔
21045,學知萬有全屬我們﹐
21046,運用得勝權柄。
21074,I must tell Jesus all of my trials;
21075,I cannot bear these burdens alone;
21076,In my distress He kindly will help me;
21077,He ever loves and cares for His own.
21078,I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
21079,I cannot bear my burdens alone;
21080,"Jesus can help me, Jesus alone."
21081,I must tell Jesus all of my troubles;
21082,"He is a kind, compassionate Friend;"
21083,"If I but ask Him, he will deliver,"
21084,And in my griefs with me He will blend.
21085,"I must tell Jesus my lack of supply,"
21086,For I cannot rid myself of care.
21087,"Jesus alone can fully satisfy,"
21088,He gives me riches beyond compare.
21089,"Tempted and tried I need a great Saviour,"
21090,One who can help my burdens to bear;
21091,"I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus;"
21092,He all my cares and sorrows will share.
21093,O how the world to evil allures me!
21094,O how my heart is tempted to sin!
21095,I must tell Jesus; He will enable
21096,Over the world the vict'ry to win.
21097,我所有苦況﹐要告訴耶穌﹐
21098,我不能獨自擔此憂鬱﹔
21099,我在患難中﹐惟主能安撫﹐
21100,擦去我眼淚﹐將我體恤。
21101,要告訴耶穌﹗全告訴耶穌﹗
21102,將我的心事向主傾吐﹔
21103,惟主能安撫﹐惟有我主。
21104,我所有困難﹐要告訴耶穌﹐
21105,我不能獨自對付遭遇﹔
21106,我一切事務﹐惟主能擔負﹐
21107,使我得安息﹐慰我情緒。
21108,我所有缺乏﹐要告訴耶穌﹐
21109,我不能獨自卸去憂慮﹔
21110,我所有需要﹐惟主能滿足﹐
21111,使我享豐富﹐綽綽有餘。
21112,我所有軟弱﹐要告訴耶穌﹐
21113,我不能獨自勝過私慾﹔
21114,我所有捆綁﹐惟主能幫助﹐
21115,使我得釋放﹐脫離罪律。
21116,我所有試探﹐要告訴耶穌﹐
21117,我不能獨自抵擋鬼魔﹔
21118,主所受試探﹐與我無所殊﹐
21119,惟主能救我﹐脫離兇惡。
21120,"While fighting for my Saviour here, the devil tries me hard;"
21121,"He uses all his mighty pow'r, my progress to retard;"
21122,"He's up to ev'ry move, And yet thro' all I prove"
21123,"A little talk with Jesus makes it right, all right."
21124,"A little talk with Jesus makes it right, all right,"
21125,"In trials of ev'ry kind, praise God I always find,"
21126,"Tho' dark the night and clouds look black and stormy overhead,"
21127,And trials of almost ev'ry kind across my path are spread;
21128,"How soon I conquer all, As to the Lord I call,"
21129,"When those who once were dearest friends begin to persecute,"
21130,"And more who once professed to love, have silent grown and mute;"
21131,"I tell Him all my grief, He quickly sends relief,"
21132,"And thus, by frequent little talks, I gain the victory;"
21133,"And march along with cheerful song, enjoying liberty;"
21134,"With Jesus as my Friend, I'll prove until the end,"
21135,我今如此為主爭戰﹐撒但真是不甘﹔
21136,牠用牠的所有權勢﹐要我中途停止﹔
21137,我卻不住禱告﹐轉使仇敵遁逃﹔
21138,因為與主說一聲﹐甚麼就都好。
21139,只要與主說一聲﹐甚麼就都好﹐
21140,只要與主說一聲﹐甚麼就都好﹔
21141,讚美主﹐我每次受試煉的時候﹐
21142,只要與主說一聲﹐甚麼就都好。
21143,我雖經歷黑暗、崎嶇﹐雖遇疾風、暴雨﹐
21144,雖然試煉不斷繼續﹐前途真是可慮﹔
21145,轉瞬我就得勝﹐因我靠主大能﹐
21146,因我與主說一聲﹐甚麼就都好。
21147,當我親友向我攻擊﹐愛人渺無信息﹐
21148,當我軟弱、孤單、無倚﹐被人誤會撇棄﹐
21149,我將傷心告主﹐祂就立刻安撫﹔
21150,真的﹐與主說一聲﹐甚麼就都好。
21151,因我與主常是密語﹐我心就無煩慮﹐
21152,逐日都是歡呼歌唱﹐穩靠救主胸膛﹔
21153,我今倚主手臂﹐我要證明到底﹕
21154,"Ah, dearest Lord, I cannot pray my fancy is not free;"
21155,"Unmannerly distractions come, and force my tho'ts from Thee."
21156,"The world that looks so dull all day glows bright on me at pray'r,"
21157,And plans that ask no tho't but then wake up and meet me there.
21158,"All nature one full fountain seems of dreamy sight and sound,"
21159,"Which, when I kneel, breaks up its deeps, and makes a deluge round."
21160,My very flesh has restless fits; my changeful limbs conspire
21161,With all these phantoms of the mind my inner self to tire.
21162,"Sweet Jesus! Teach me how to prize these tedious hours when I,"
21163,"Foolish and mute before Thy Face, in helpless worship lie."
21164,"Yet Thou art oft most present, Lord! In weak distracted prayer:"
21165,A sinner out of heart with self most often finds Thee there.
21166,"Had I kept stricter watch each hour o'er tongue and eye and ear,"
21167,"Had I but mortified all day each joy as it came near,"
21168,"Had I, dear Lord! No pleasure found but in the thought of Thee,"
21169,"Prayer would have come unsought, and been a truer liberty."
21170,"My Saviour! Why should I complain, and why fear aught but sin?"
21171,Distractions are but outward things; Thy peace dwells far within.
21172,"These surface-troubles come and go, like rufflings of the sea;"
21173,"The deeper depth is out of reach to all, my God, but Thee."
21174,親愛主﹐我不能禱告﹐幻想重重圍繞﹔
21175,紛亂雜念四面群起﹐迫我心思離祢。
21176,黯淡俗世忽放光明﹐當我心趨天庭﹔
21177,計劃、方案不思而起﹐不斷向我迎逼。
21178,一切天然﹐猶如水泉﹕聲影幻夢源源﹔
21179,當我屈膝﹐更如山洪﹐爆發聲勢洶洶。
21180,所有肉體趁勢發動﹐易變肢體協同﹔
21181,激起心思虛幻錯覺﹐使我深處厭倦。
21182,哦﹐主﹐教我寶貝這個疲乏、沉悶時刻﹔
21183,雖然愚昧、無助、無言﹐仍俯伏在祢前。
21184,因祢常來親近懷抱﹐聽我微弱禱告﹔
21185,只要罪人願脫自己﹐必定得尋見祢。
21186,是否我願時刻把守我心﹐我眼﹐我口﹖
21187,是否我願終日抑制屬己宴樂之事﹖
21188,哦﹐主﹐是否除祢以外我無所樂﹐所愛﹖
21189,如此禱告必然通暢﹐必然自由釋放。
21190,既是如此﹐我有何慮﹖除罪﹐我有何懼﹖
21191,紛亂心思雖在外侵﹐平安卻在內盈。
21192,一切反覆煩惱折磨﹐猶如海面興波﹔
21193,但心深處無能震動﹐惟主掌權其衷。
21194,"He's the one I love in the morning, He's the one I love at noon."
21195,"He's the one at evening twilight, He's the one at midnight gloom."
21196,"He's the oak and I'm the ivy, He's the potter, I'm the clay."
21197,"For my Lord and me, there'll never be aparting day."
21198,祂是我愛在破曉清晨﹐祂是我愛在午正﹐
21199,祂是我愛在於黃昏﹐祂是我愛在深更﹔
21200,祂是大樹﹐我是弱籐﹐祂是窯匠﹐我泥土﹔
21201,我和我主有勝於友朋﹐永不可分。
21214,"Wonderful, wonderful Jesus! Who can compare with Thee?"
21215,"Wonderful, wonderful Jesus! Fairer than all art Thou to me."
21216,"Wonderful, wonderful Jesus! O how my heart loves Thee!"
21217,"Fairer than all the fairest, Jesus art Thou to me."
21218,奇妙又奇妙的耶穌﹐誰能與祢相比?
21219,奇妙又奇妙的耶穌﹐祢比一切是最華美。
21220,奇妙又奇妙的耶穌﹐我心最愛慕祢﹔
21221,華美中祢最華美﹐耶穌是最華美。
21244,"Nothing between, Lord, nothing between,"
21245,"Let me Thy glory see, draw my soul close to Thee,"
21246,Then speak in love to me
21247,"Nothing between, nothing between"
21248,"Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;"
21249,Let not earth's din and noise stifle Thy still small voice;
21250,In it let me rejoice —
21251,"Nothing between, Lord, nothing between"
21252,"Nothing of earthly care, nothing of tear or prayer,"
21253,No robe that self may wear —
21254,"Nothing between, nothing between."
21255,"Unbelief disappear, vanish each doubt and fear,"
21256,Fading when Thou art near —
21257,"Shine with unclouded ray, chasing each mist away,"
21258,O'er my whole heart bear sway —
21259,"Thus may I walk with Thee, Thee only may I see,"
21260,Thine only let me be —
21261,"Till Thine eternal light, rising on earth's dark night,"
21262,Bursts on my open sight —
21263,"Till the last conflict o'er, I stand on Canaan's shore"
21264,With Thee for evermore
21265,沒有間隔﹐主﹐沒有間隔﹐
21266,讓我見祢榮面﹐引我近祢身邊﹐
21267,然後聽祢慈言﹔
21268,沒有間隔﹐沒有間隔。
21269,但願地上翻騰不亂祢的微聲﹐
21270,我願向祢忠誠﹔
21271,沒有間隔﹐主﹐沒有間隔
21272,沒有世上掛慮﹐沒有屬己興趣﹐
21273,沒有掩飾空虛﹔
21274,當祢親近我時﹐疑惑完全消失﹐
21275,恐懼也都停止﹔
21276,求祢照耀輝煌﹐消滅一切邪光﹐
21277,作我無限心王﹔
21278,願我如此隨祢﹐願我所見惟祢﹐
21279,願我所歸惟祢﹔
21280,直到我眼看見﹐祢的永光顯現﹐
21281,沒有任何試煉﹔
21282,直到此生過去﹐我不再作客旅﹐
21283,永遠與祢同居﹔
21284,As pants the hart for cooling streams
21285,"When heated in the chase,"
21286,"So longs my soul, O God,"
21287,"For Thee, And Thy refreshing grace."
21288,"Why restless, why cast down, my soul?"
21289,"Trust God, who will employ"
21290,"His aid for thee, and change these sighs"
21291,To thankful hymns of joy.
21292,"For Thee, my God, the living God,"
21293,My thirsty soul doth pine;
21294,"Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,"
21295,Thou Majesty Divine?
21296,"God of my strength, how long shall I,"
21297,"Like one forgotten, mourn,"
21298,"Forlorn, forsaken and exposed"
21299,To my oppressor's scorn?
21300,"Hope still, and thou shalt sing"
21301,"The praise of Him who is thy God,"
21302,Thy health's eternal spring.
21303,我如困鹿切慕溪水﹐
21304,裏面乾渴難言﹔
21305,哦﹐神﹐我心惟祢是追﹐
21306,並祢復甦恩典。
21307,我的救主﹐我無安息﹐
21308,我心饑渴要祢﹔
21309,祢來相親﹐歎息逃避﹐
21310,充滿無限歡喜。
21311,祢是我的生命力量﹐
21312,也是我的光亮﹔
21313,祢是糧食使我飽嘗
21314,祢的恩典無量。
21315,祢的笑臉是我拯救﹐
21316,向祢﹐我久仰望﹔
21317,祢的同在是我所求﹐
21318,願祢多加恩賞。
21319,我心乾渴難言﹔
21320,哦﹐神﹐除祢我還有誰﹖
21321,惟祢滿我所願。
21322,"As the eyes of the servants look unto the hand of their masters,"
21323,"As the eyes of the maiden look unto the hand of her mistress,"
21324,"So our eyes look upon the Lord, the Lord our God,"
21325,Until He has mercy upon us.
21326,僕人的眼睛怎樣望主人的手﹐
21327,使女的眼睛怎樣望主母的手﹐
21328,我們的眼睛也照樣望我們的神﹐
21329,直到祂﹐直到祂憐憫我們。
21330,"I come to the garden alone,"
21331,"While the dew is still on the roses,"
21332,"And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,"
21333,The Son of God discloses.
21334,"And He walks with me, and He talks with me,"
21335,And He tells me I am His own;
21336,"And the joy we share as we tarry there,"
21337,None other has ever known.
21338,He speaks and the sound of His voice
21339,"Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,"
21340,"And the melody that He gave to me,"
21341,Within my heart is ringing.
21342,I'd stay in the garden with Him
21343,"Tho' the night around me be falling,"
21344,"But He bids me go; thro' the voice of woe,"
21345,His voice to me is calling.
21346,我獨自來到花園中﹐
21347,玫瑰花上露珠亮晶晶﹔
21348,忽有溫柔聲向我細叮嚀﹐
21349,原來是神子耶穌﹗
21350,祂與我同行﹐又和我談心﹐
21351,輕對我說我屬於祂﹔
21352,我與祂在一起﹐情意殷殷﹐
21353,更誰知此中歡欣﹖
21354,祂說話聲何等美妙﹐
21355,眾雀鳥都寂然而恭聽﹔
21356,天上恩愛語﹐天上好音調﹐
21357,在我心輕輕鳴應。
21358,當暮色漸漸滿園林﹐
21359,我還依依不忍遽離開﹔
21360,"主卻輕囑說﹕""此去傳好音﹐"
21361,"我刻刻與你同去。"""
21402,Shut in with God in the secret place:
21403,"Here in His presence beholding His face,"
21404,Gaining the power to run in the race;
21405,I long to be shut in with God.
21406,在隱密處與神同關鎖﹕
21407,沐於祂同在﹐瞻仰祂榮臉﹐
21408,從祂得能力一路奔向前﹔
21409,我切願與神同關鎖。
21410,"When morning gilds the skies, my heart awaking cries:"
21411,"May Jesus Christ be praised! Alike at work or prayer,"
21412,To Jesus I repair; may Jesus Christ be praised!
21413,The night becomes as day when from the heart we say:
21414,May Jesus Christ be praised! The pow'rs of darkness fear
21415,When this sweet chant they hear: May Jesus Christ be praised!
21416,"Sing, suns and stars of space, sing, ye that see His face,"
21417,"Sing, Jesus Christ be praised! Let all the earth around"
21418,Ring joyous with the sound: May Jesus Christ be praised!
21419,Be this while life is mine my canticle divine:
21420,"May Jesus Christ be praised! be this th'eternal song,"
21421,Through all the ages long: May Jesus Christ be praised!
21422,晨光掠天而過﹐我心醒來喊說﹕
21423,"""願頌讚歸耶穌﹗""不論工作、禱告﹐"
21424,"我要向主倚靠﹐""願頌讚歸耶穌﹗"""
21425,黑夜要變白晝﹐當我衷心歌謳﹕
21426,"""願頌讚歸耶穌﹗""黑暗權勢潰崩﹐"
21427,"當它聽聞此聲﹕""願頌讚歸耶穌﹗"""
21428,日、月、星辰歌唱﹐天使天軍頌揚﹕
21429,"""願頌讚歸耶穌﹗""全地同來響應﹐"
21430,"齊發歡樂歌聲﹕""願頌讚歸耶穌﹗"""
21431,當我尚存一息﹐我仍歌唱不已﹕
21432,"""願頌讚歸耶穌﹗""唱此永遠歌頌﹐"
21433,"直至永世無窮﹐""願頌讚歸耶穌﹗"""
21434,New ev'ry morning is the love
21435,Our wak'ning and uprising prove;
21436,"Thro' sleep and darkness safely brought,"
21437,"Restored to life, and pow'r, and thought."
21438,"New mercies, each returning day,"
21439,Hover around us while we pray;
21440,"New perils past, new sins forgiv'n,"
21441,"New thoughts of God, new hopes of heav'n."
21442,"If, on our daily course, our mind"
21443,"Be set to hallow all we find,"
21444,New treasures still of countless price
21445,God will provide for sacrifice.
21446,"Old friends, old scenes will lovelier be,"
21447,As more of heav'n in each we see;
21448,Some soft'ning gleam of love and prayer
21449,Shall dawn on every cross and care.
21450,"The trivial round, the common task,"
21451,Will furnish all we ought to ask;
21452,Room to deny ourselves; a road
21453,To bring us daily nearer God.
21454,"Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love"
21455,"Fit us for perfect rest above,"
21456,"And help us, this and every day,"
21457,To live more nearly as we pray.
21458,每日早晨愛都新鮮﹐
21459,再顯在我重新回醒﹔
21460,使我平安度過睡眠﹐
21461,復有思想、能力、生命。
21462,每個新日有新憐憫﹐
21463,當我禱告都在四圍﹕
21464,新的赦免﹐新的親近﹐
21465,對神新知﹐對天新窺。
21466,如果我的每日道路﹐
21467,定規都要分別為聖﹔
21468,無價之寶﹐新的事物﹐
21469,神正豫備作我祭牲。
21470,舊人﹐舊地都更可愛﹐
21471,如果彼此都更思家﹔
21472,今日求賜軟化忍耐﹐
21473,顯在每一個十字架。
21474,簡單工作﹐平常人地﹐
21475,都會成為禱告張本﹔
21476,都是機會可以捨己﹐
21477,使我每日更親我神。
21478,但主﹐求祢因祢的愛﹐
21479,準備我心為著來朝﹔
21480,叫我今天﹐每天﹐都該
21481,生活更像我的禱告。
21482,"Awake, my soul, and with the sun"
21483,Thy daily stage of duty run;
21484,Shake off dull sloth and joyful rise
21485,To pay thy morning sacrifice.
21486,"Wake and lift up thyself, my heart,"
21487,"And with the angels bear thy part,"
21488,Who all night long unwearied sing
21489,High praise to the eternal King.
21490,"All praise to Thee, Who safe hast kept"
21491,And hast refreshed me while I slept:
21492,"Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake"
21493,I may of endless light partake.
21494,"Lord, I my vows to Thee renew;"
21495,Disperse my sins as morning dew;
21496,"Guard my fist springs of thought and will,"
21497,And with Thyself my spirit fill.
21498,"Direct, control, suggest, this day,"
21499,"All I design, or do, or say,"
21500,"That all my pow'rs, with all their might,"
21501,In Thy sole glory may unite.
21502,醒來﹐我魂﹐當隨朝陽﹐
21503,開始一天當盡本分﹔
21504,放棄怠惰﹐早起剛強﹐
21505,歡然獻祭在此清晨。
21506,醒來﹐我心﹐舉起自己﹐
21507,效法天使盡你職守﹔
21508,他們一夜未曾歇息﹐
21509,不斷向神讚美、歌謳。
21510,感謝我主將我保護﹐
21511,安度睡眠﹐恢復新鮮﹔
21512,有日當我從死復甦﹐
21513,容我得進光明高天。
21514,主﹐我向你重申誓願﹐
21515,驅盡我罪﹐如露消散﹔
21516,保守我心初萌意念﹐
21517,以祢自己將我充滿。
21518,求主提議、引導、管理
21519,一切所思、所言、所習﹔
21520,願我所有才幹、能力﹐
21521,能以集合歸榮與祢。
21522,"""讚美聖父、聖子、聖靈。"""
21523,"Day is dying in the west, heav'n is touching earth with rest;"
21524,Wait and worship while the night sets her ev'ning lamps alight
21525,Thro' all the sky.
21526,"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts."
21527,Heav'n and earth are full of Thee!
21528,"Heav'n and earth are praising Thee, O Lord most high!"
21529,"Lord of life, beneath the dome of the universe, Thy home,"
21530,"Gather us, who seek Thy face, to the fold of Thy embrace,"
21531,For Thou art nigh.
21532,"While the deep'ning shadows fall, heart of Love, enfolding all,"
21533,"Through the glory and the grace of the stars that veil Thy face,"
21534,Our hearts ascend.
21535,"When forever form our sight pass the stars, the day, the night,"
21536,"Lord of angels, on our eyes let eternal morning rise,"
21537,And shadows end.
21538,夕陽西沉大地靜﹐蝟務完畢我心定﹔
21539,晚星高照暗中明﹐幽夜近主靈裏清﹐
21540,靜候俯伏。
21541,近乎﹐近乎﹐近乎﹐可近之主﹗
21542,我心所羨靈所慕﹐
21543,是祢可愛的面目﹐可親之主﹗
21544,在這宇宙廣廈中﹐我心尋求祢面容﹔
21545,深願能在我四圍﹐所見全是祢光輝﹐
21546,使我滿足。
21547,當這夜影愈幽深﹐我心羨慕愈殷勤﹔
21548,願能衝過眾星辰﹐得見祢面﹐近祢身﹐
21549,永不孤苦。
21550,有日太空的繁星﹐在我眼前全不明﹔
21551,願那永遠的早晨﹐在我眼前顯光明﹐
21552,夜影俱無。
21553,"Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,"
21554,It is not night if Thou be near;
21555,"Oh, may no earthborn cloud arise,"
21556,To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.
21557,When the soft dews of kindly sleep
21558,"My wearied eyelids gently steep,"
21559,Be my last thought how sweet to rest
21560,Forever on my Saviour's breast.
21561,"Abide with me from morn till eve,"
21562,For without Thee I cannot live;
21563,"Abide with me when night is nigh,"
21564,For without Thee I dare not die.
21565,If some poor wandering child of Thine
21566,"Has spurned today the voice divine,"
21567,"Now Lord, the gracious work begin;"
21568,Let him no more lie down in sin.
21569,Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
21570,With blessings from Thy boundless store;
21571,"Be every mourner's sleep tonight,"
21572,"Life infant's slumbers, pure and light."
21573,"Come near, and bless us when we wake,"
21574,Ere through the world our way we take;
21575,Till in the ocean of Thy love
21576,We lose ourselves in Thee above.
21577,救主耶穌﹐我的太陽﹐
21578,有祢同在﹐夜也明亮﹔
21579,勿讓人世有雲遮掩
21580,僕人心眼﹐不見慈顏。
21581,倦眼欲合﹐頻頻催眠﹐
21582,睡如甘露﹐潤我夕薦﹔
21583,深願今晚最後思念﹐
21584,乃是永世息祢胸前。
21585,與我同在自晨至夕﹐
21586,離祢﹐我覺生無意義﹔
21587,無祢﹐我懼死蔭臨到﹐
21588,求祢相偕自晚至朝。
21589,設有遊子背父流浪﹐
21590,縱聞父聲依然心剛﹔
21591,深願此刻祢親工作﹐
21592,勿使仍在罪中墮落。
21593,病弱兒女﹐求主看護﹐
21594,缺乏信徒﹐求主眷顧﹐
21595,愁苦弟兄﹐求主賜憐﹐
21596,能如嬰孩母懷安眠。
21597,當我睡醒﹐求主賜福﹐
21598,扶我行走人生路途﹔
21599,直至那日被提祢旁﹐
21600,溶化在祢愛的海洋。
21601,"It only takes a spark to get a fire going,"
21602,And soon all those around can warm up to its glowing.
21603,That's how it is with God's love once you've experienced it;
21604,You spread His love to ev'ry one; you want to pass it on.
21605,"What a wondrous time is spring when all the trees are budding,"
21606,"The birds begin to sing, the flowers start their blooming,"
21607,"You want to sing, it's fresh like spring, you want to pass it on."
21608,"I wish for you, my friend, this happiness that I've found,"
21609,"You can depend on Him, it matters not where you're bound."
21610,"I'll shout it from the mountain top, I want my world to know,"
21611,"The Lord of love has come to me, I want to pass it on."
21612,一點星星之火﹐可燃起營火興旺﹔
21613,不久四圍群眾﹐都得享溫暖、亮光。
21614,"神愛也正是這樣﹐當你經歷祂救恩,"
21615,你要將祂大愛傳開﹐你要去傳給人。
21616,春光明媚奇妙﹐嫩芽從樹上伸張﹔
21617,小鳥開聲歌唱﹐百花都爭先開放。
21618,神愛也正是這樣﹐當你經歷祂救恩﹐
21619,你要歌唱﹐如春新樣﹐你要去傳給人。
21620,朋友們﹐我切望你來得我這喜樂﹔
21621,你可向神投靠﹐不論你光景如何。
21622,我要在山頂喊叫﹐要向全世界宣稱﹕
21623,"""恩愛的主已拯救我﹐我要去傳給人。"""
21640,"O Zion, haste, your mission high fulfilling,"
21641,To tell to all the world that God is Light;
21642,That He who made all nations is not willing
21643,"One soul should perish, lost in shades of night."
21644,"Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;"
21645,"Tidings of Jesus, redemption, and release"
21646,Behold how many thousands still are lying
21647,"Bound in the darksome prison-house of sin,"
21648,"With none to tell them of the Saviour's dying,"
21649,Or of the life He died for them to win.
21650,'Tis thine to save from peril of perdition
21651,"The souls for whom the Lord His life laid down,"
21652,"Beware lest, slothful to fulfill thy mission,"
21653,Thou lose one jewel that should deck His crown.
21654,"Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation"
21655,"That God, in whom they move and live is love;"
21656,"Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation,"
21657,And died on earth that men might live above.
21658,Give of thy sons to bear the message glorious;
21659,Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;
21660,Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;
21661,And all thou spendest Jesus will repay.
21662,"He comes again, O Zion ere thou meet Him,"
21663,Make known to every heart His saving grace;
21664,Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him;
21665,Through thy neglect unfit to see His face.
21666,教會趕快遵命出去普天下﹐
21667,通知他們神是如何慈愛﹔
21668,使之深曉神已成功祂救法﹐
21669,並不願意一人滅亡悲哀。
21670,傳揚好信息﹐和平福音﹗
21671,傳揚主耶穌﹐已經救贖罪人。
21672,請看﹐何止千萬的人在罪中﹐
21673,受了捆綁﹐一直事奉鬼魔﹐
21674,無人前去通知﹕救贖已成功﹐
21675,救主已經得勝﹐死而復活。
21676,主能救人脫離罪惡的捆綁﹐
21677,亞當種類﹐因祂捨命結束﹔
21678,我們應當不畏赴火與蹈湯﹐
21679,免得攔阻一人來信耶穌。
21680,世界各民、各國、各方、並各人﹐
21681,我們都當前往傳揚恩典﹐
21682,叫人知道神是如何成肉身﹐
21683,受死在地﹐使人永生在天。
21684,不該攔阻兒女獻身往邊荒﹐
21685,應當奉獻財物幫助福音﹐
21686,並且禱告﹐求神賜福並推廣﹔
21687,你的犧牲﹐主必記念在心。
21688,應當記得﹐救主已將快再臨﹐
21689,機會一過﹐就難再盡本分﹔
21690,只怕有人﹐是因你我不熱心﹐
21691,不能得救﹐也不能進天城。
21692,A hundred thousand souls a day
21693,Are passing one by one away
21694,"In Christless guilt and gloom; without one ray of hope or light,"
21695,"With future dark as endless night,"
21696,"They're passing to their doom, they're passing to their doom."
21697,"They're passing, passing fast away in thousands day by day;"
21698,"O Holy Ghost, Thy people move,"
21699,Baptize their hearts with faith and love
21700,"And consecrate their gold. At Jesus' feet their millions pour,"
21701,"And all their ranks unite once more,"
21702,"As in the days of old, as in the days of old."
21703,The Master's coming draweth near;
21704,The Son of Man will soon appear;
21705,"His kingdom is at hand. But ere that glorious day can be,"
21706,This gospel of the kingdom we
21707,"Must preach in every land, must preach in every land."
21708,"Oh, let us then His coming haste,"
21709,"Oh, let us end this awful waste"
21710,Of souls that never die. A thousand millions still are lost;
21711,"A Saviour's blood has paid the cost,"
21712,"Oh, hear their dying cry, Oh, hear their dying cry."
21713,"They're passing, passing fast away,"
21714,"In Christ-less guilt and gloom. O Church of Christ, what wilt thou say"
21715,"When, in the awful judgement day,"
21716,"They charge thee with their doom, they charge thee with their doom?"
21717,每日都有千萬靈魂﹐
21718,一個一個走向沉淪﹐
21719,沒有神﹐沒指望﹔沒有救恩﹐沒有光線﹐
21720,前途有如永夜黑暗﹐
21721,他們快要滅亡﹐他們快要滅亡。
21722,將滅亡﹐滅亡﹗每日千萬人奔向滅亡﹗
21723,他們奔向滅亡﹗他們奔向減亡﹗
21724,懇求聖靈攪動教會﹐
21725,用信和愛浸透心內﹔
21726,為主費財﹐費力﹐一切財寶獻主腳前﹔
21727,所有聖徒再次結聯﹐
21728,復興有如往昔﹐復興有如往昔。
21729,主的再來即將應驗﹐
21730,人子不久就要顯現﹐
21731,祂的國度在望﹔在這榮耀大日之前﹐
21732,天國福音必須傳遍
21733,各國、各民、各方﹐各國、各民、各方。
21734,哦﹐快促進主的降臨﹗
21735,哦﹐速止住靈魂沉淪﹐
21736,免受痛苦無盡﹔億萬靈魂仍舊失喪﹐
21737,救主寶血卻已清償﹐
21738,請聽他們哀吟﹗請聽他們哀吟﹗
21739,他們滅亡﹐快要滅亡﹐
21740,每日千萬靈魂失喪﹐
21741,沒指望﹐沒有神﹔在那可怕審判台前﹐
21742,主的教會如何答辯—
21743,他們對妳控訴﹗他們對妳控訴﹗
21780,Hast thou no scar?
21781,"No hidden scar on foot, or side or hand?"
21782,"I hear thee sung throughout the land,"
21783,"I hear them hail thy shining star,"
21784,Hast thou no scar? no scar?
21785,Hast thou no wound?
21786,"Yet I was wounded by the archers, spent,"
21787,Leaned Me against a tree; and rent
21788,"By ravening beasts 'round me, I swooned:"
21789,Hast thou no wound? no wound?
21790,No wound? no scar?
21791,"Yet, as the Master shall the servant be,"
21792,And pierced the feet that follow Me;
21793,But whole? Can he have followed far
21794,Who has no wound nor scar?
21795,你怎沒有傷痕？
21796,沒有傷痕在你肋旁？
21797,你名反倒遠播四方，
21798,你光反倒照射輝煌，
21799,我是受迫掛在樹上，
21800,四圍盡是殘忍、狂妄，
21801,我是受盡一切創傷，
21802,怎能你無傷痕？
21803,僕人該與主人同樣！
21804,本該與我同受創傷，
21805,而你卻是完整無恙！
21806,他們為我受人捆綁，
21807,枷鎖、監禁，並且流放，
21808,或是捨身，餵獅廣場，
21809,你是沒有傷痕！
21810,我受摧殘，飲人鋒鋩，
21811,他們忍受忌恨、刀棒，
21812,你卻平安，不缺寧康，
21813,你卻沒有傷痕！
21814,是否你向世俗依傍，
21815,你怕自己利益失喪，
21816,遠遠跟隨不甚明朗，
21817,所以沒有傷痕？
21818,沒有疲倦，只有安享？
21819,能否有人忠心，受賞？
21820,能否有人跟隨羔羊，
21821,而他沒有傷痕？
21822,"Captured by Thy beauty, Lord,"
21823,"Thus, my heart would ever be;"
21824,"Constrained by Thy dying love,"
21825,Never will I go out free.
21826,"Make me a captive of Thy love,"
21827,Ever to love Thee as I ought;
21828,Channels of love that I might be;
21829,"O, make me a captive of Thy love."
21830,祢的美麗將我心奪，
21831,我心甘願讓祢掌握;
21832,祢愛將我全人捆綁，
21833,我真不願再去流蕩。
21834,使我作祢愛的俘虜，
21835,一生愛祢遵祢所囑;
21836,使我成祢愛的流露，
21837,哦，使我作祢愛的俘虜。
21838,"Saviour, Thy dying love Thou gavest me,"
21839,"Nor should I aught withhold, Dear Lord, from Thee;"
21840,"In love my soul would bow, My heart fulfill its vow,"
21841,"Some offering bring Thee Now, Something for Thee."
21842,"At the blest mercy seat Pleading for me,"
21843,"My feeble faith looks up, Jesus to Thee:"
21844,"Help me the cross to bear, Thy wondrous love declare,"
21845,"Some song to raise, or prayer Something for Thee."
21846,"Give me a faithful heart, Likeness to Thee,"
21847,That each departing day Henceforth may see
21848,"Some work of love begun, Some deed of kindness done,"
21849,"Some wand'rer sought and won, Something for Thee."
21850,All that I am and have- Thy gifts so free-
21851,"In joy, in grief, thro' life, Dear Lord, for Thee!"
21852,"And when Thy face I see, My ransomed soul shall be"
21853,"Through all eternity, Something for Thee."
21854,救主受死大愛已賜給我，
21855,主，我不願為己保留甚麼；
21856,我在愛中瞻仰，將我心願還償；
21857,今將供物獻上，奉獻與你。
21858,主在父寶座前為我求呼，
21859,我的微弱信心只看耶穌；
21860,助我十架背上，將你大愛傳揚；
21861,以禱告和歌唱，奉獻與你。
21862,賜我一顆忠心，像你榮形，
21863,一日又過一日，靠主顯明；
21864,一些愛的工作，一些良善之果，
21865,一些罪人心奪，奉獻與你。
21866,一切所是所有，是你眷顧；
21867,一生全是為主，或樂或苦！
21868,一日見你榮面，因你贖回恩典
21869,得進無限永遠，奉獻與你。
21870,"I belong to Jesus, I am not mine own;"
21871,All I have and all I am shall be His alone.
21872,我今屬於耶穌，不再屬自已；
21873,我所是並我所有全都歸於你。
21874,"Having seen the world's fair beauty,"
21875,"Lord, I would be blind once more,"
21876,Lest I lost the loving Presence.
21877,And Delight I knew before.
21878,Lest I lost the loving Presence
21879,"Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,"
21880,"I can see in paradise,"
21881,But while here on earth His mercy
21882,For my blindesss will suffice.
21883,I no more would be delivered
21884,"From my thorn, but look for grace,"
21885,While within the veil His glory
21886,Shineth brightly on my face
21887,"In the deep dark night, His beauty"
21888,"I by faith, not sight, may trace;"
21889,"He was ridiculed and hated,"
21890,Yet I see His glorious face.
21891,Sun and moonlight far surpassing
21892,"Clouds and Milky Way o'erspread,"
21893,Is the glory all transcending
21894,Shining from His thorn-crowned head.
21895,世上景色我已一閱，
21896,願祢使我目復盲;
21897,不然，我怕祂的喜悅，
21898,不如從前的顯彰。
21899,晨曦，晚霞，星光，雲錦，
21900,一切都留等樂園;
21901,今天在此有祂憐憫，
21902,我甘盲目無所戀。
21903,我今不望離開苦刺，
21904,接受軟弱仰望恩;
21905,座上榮耀，幔內啟示，
21906,依然照亮無眼人。
21907,黑夜沉沉何等美麗，
21908,摸索用信不用眼;
21909,祂受人的譏諷厭棄，
21910,我見祂的發光臉。
21911,超過月亮，超過日頭，
21912,超過星河並雲霄;
21913,乃是那戴荊冕聖首，
21914,所顯無比的榮耀。
21915,"Just as I am, myself I give to Thee."
21916,Take me and make me what I ought to be
21917,"In spirit, soul, and body as Thou wilt."
21918,"At any cost, help me my all to yield."
21919,照我本相，我將自己給你；
21920,願你收納，模我成你心意。
21921,不住作工，在我靈、魂、身體；
21922,任何代價，助我降服於你。
21964,All for Jesus! all for Jesus!
21965,All my being's ransomed pow'rs;
21966,"All my thoughts and works and doings,"
21967,All my days and all my hours.
21968,All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
21969,"All my days and all my hours,"
21970,'Tis the longing of my heart.
21971,For His love constrains and hastens
21972,Me to give Him every part.
21973,All for Him to sanctify:
21974,"My whole body, soul and spirit,"
21975,All I have until I die.
21976,Let my hands perform His bidding;
21977,Let my feet run in His ways;
21978,Let mine eyes see Jesus only;
21979,Let my lips speak forth His praise.
21980,"Since mine eyes were fixed on Jesus,"
21981,I've lost sight of all beside —
21982,"So enchained my spirit's vision,"
21983,Looking at the Crucified.
21984,"Oh, what wonder! How amazing!"
21985,"Jesus, glorious King of kings,"
21986,"Designs to call me His beloved,"
21987,Lets me rest beneath His wings.
21988,都歸耶穌，都歸耶穌，
21989,都歸耶穌理當然；
21990,我既是主寶血所贖，
21991,主就當得所有權。
21992,都歸耶穌我救主！
21993,都歸耶穌我救主。
21994,都歸耶穌心所慕；
21995,主愛激勵，主愛催促，
21996,怎能不都歸耶穌？
21997,都歸耶穌成為聖；
21998,身體、靈、魂、時間、財物，
21999,所是、所有、並所能。
22000,願我雙手歸主使用，
22001,願我雙腳跟主行，
22002,願我兩目瞻主聖容，
22003,願我兩唇頌主名。
22004,自從我眼注視耶穌，
22005,所有事物全變色；
22006,一望主在十架受苦，
22007,我就甘願負主軛。
22008,奇妙恩典，深高闊長！
22009,我口歌頌，心感戴；
22010,榮耀救主，王中之王，
22011,竟然也看我可愛！
22036,Take my life and let it be
22037,"Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;"
22038,"Take my moments and my days,"
22039,Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
22040,Thou didst wear a crown of thorns for me;
22041,Thou didst give Thy life on Calvary.
22042,"Lord, I give to Thee my life and all to be"
22043,Thine henceforth eternally.
22044,"Take my hands, and let them move"
22045,At the impulse of Thy love;
22046,Take my feet and let them be
22047,Swift and beautiful for Thee.
22048,Take my voice and let me sing
22049,"Always, only, for my King;"
22050,Take my lips and let them be
22051,Filled with messages from Thee.
22052,Take my silver and my gold;
22053,Not a mite would I withhold;
22054,"Take my intellect, and use"
22055,Every pow'r as Thou shalt choose.
22056,"Take my will, and make it Thine;"
22057,It shall be no longer mine.
22058,Take my heart; it is Thine own;
22059,It shall be Thy royal throne.
22060,"Take my love; my Lord, I pour"
22061,At Thy feet its treasure-store;
22062,Take myself and I will be
22063,"Ever, only, all for Thee."
22064,收我此生作奉獻﹐
22065,毫無保留在祢前﹔
22066,收我光陰並時日﹐
22067,用以榮耀祢不置。
22068,為我荊棘冠冕祢肯戴﹐
22069,為我釘死苦架祢受害﹐
22070,為祢﹐我願獻上我命與我愛﹐
22071,為祢﹐事祢到萬代。
22072,收我雙手為祢用﹐
22073,因愛催促才舉動﹔
22074,收我兩足為祢行﹐
22075,蹤跡佳美傳祢名。
22076,收我聲音來歌唱﹐
22077,天上榮耀的君王﹔
22078,收我唇舌作用器﹐
22079,前來述說祢信息。
22080,收我金銀和所有﹐
22081,不敢分毫有私留﹔
22082,收我聰明並才幹﹐
22083,前來作成祢心歡。
22084,收我意志永屬祢﹐
22085,從今不再為自己﹔
22086,收我的心作寶座﹐
22087,祢住裡面號令我。
22088,收我愛情﹐哦﹐我主﹐
22089,只在祢前纔傾吐﹔
22090,收我全人﹐靈、魂、體﹐
22091,一切活著為著祢。
22134,"Following Jesus, ever day by day,"
22135,Nothing can harm me when He leads the way;
22136,"Sunshine or shadow, what e'er be-fall,"
22137,Jesus my Saviour is my All in All.
22138,跟隨主耶穌，立志永不改；
22139,有主領我路，誰能加損害？
22140,無論何環境，不分晝夜，
22141,耶穌我救主成為我一切。
22163,"What length, breadth, height, and depth!"
22164,What greatness is His love!
22165,"How else could I, a sinner vile,"
22166,Be in such grace and bliss?
22167,My Saviour paid a price
22168,That I might ransomed be;
22169,"Now willingly I'd bear the cross,"
22170,And follow faithfully.
22171,The dearest things of earth
22172,I gladly leave behind;
22173,"Nor life, nor death can hold me back —"
22174,'Tis Christ my soul would find.
22175,All worldly gains or fame —
22176,What good are they to me?
22177,"The Lord didst become poor for me,"
22178,Poor like Him I would be.
22179,My Saviour do I love;
22180,His smile I would obtain.
22181,"For Him, let gain be turned to loss,"
22182,Let ease be turned to pain.
22183,"Jesus, my gracious Lord,"
22184,My true comfort to be.
22185,Whom have I on earth or in heav'n
22186,"To love, save only Thee?"
22187,"Let oppositions come,"
22188,And hardships from above;
22189,I only ask that Thou wouldst but
22190,Enfold me in Thy love.
22191,"Lord, I now ask of Thee,"
22192,By grace lead Thou me on;
22193,Stand by my side to be my strength
22194,Till all dark days are gone.
22195,For Satan often tries
22196,To hold me in restraint;
22197,"Unless Thou wouldst empow'r me, Lord,"
22198,Thy name I might attaint.
22199,"While time is short indeed,"
22200,"Uphold me, Lord, till then;"
22201,"At Thy return, I'll sing at once:"
22202,"""Hallelujah! Amen."""
22203,主愛長闊高深﹐
22204,實在不能推測﹔
22205,不然﹐像我這樣罪人﹐
22206,怎能滿被恩澤。
22207,我主出了重價﹐
22208,買我回來歸祂﹔
22209,我今願意背十字架﹐
22210,忠心一路跟祂。
22211,我今撇下一切﹐
22212,為要得著基督﹔
22213,生也、死也﹐想都不屑﹐
22214,有何使我回顧﹖
22215,親友、欲好、利名﹐
22216,於我夫復何用﹖
22217,恩主為我變作苦貧﹐
22218,我今為主亦窮。
22219,我愛我的救主﹐
22220,我求祂的稱是﹔
22221,為祂之故﹐安逸變苦﹐
22222,利益變為損失。
22223,祢是我的安慰﹐
22224,我的恩主耶穌！
22225,除祢之外在天何歸﹖
22226,在地何所愛慕﹖
22227,艱苦、反對、飄零﹐
22228,我今一起不理﹔
22229,只求我主用祢愛情﹐
22230,繞我靈、魂、身體。
22231,主阿﹐我今求祢﹐
22232,施恩引導小子﹐
22233,立在我旁﹐常加我力﹐
22234,平安經過此世。
22235,撒但、世界、肉體﹐
22236,時常試探、欺凌﹔
22237,祢若不加小子能力﹐
22238,恐將貽羞祢名！
22239,現今時候不多﹐
22240,求主使我脫塵﹔
22241,祢一再來﹐我即唱說﹕
22242,哈利路亞！阿門！
22243,"Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,"
22244,Where the flow'rs are blooming and the sweet waters flow;
22245,"Ev'rywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,"
22246,Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.
22247,Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
22248,"Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!"
22249,Ev'rywhere He leads me I would follow on!
22250,Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;
22251,"With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear;"
22252,Danger cannot harm me if my Lord is near.
22253,"Down in the valley or upon the mountain steep,"
22254,Close beside my Saviour would my soul ever keep;
22255,"He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,"
22256,Up to where they gather on the fills of God.
22257,我今願跟隨耶穌，不論走何路；
22258,或是平坦大路，或是崎嶇窄途；
22259,既有救主親自相輔，我就不躊躇，
22260,一路跟隨耶穌，直到進天府。
22261,跟隨！跟隨！我願跟隨耶穌！
22262,不論我往何處，我必跟隨主！
22263,不論領我何處，我必跟隨主！
22264,我今願跟隨耶穌，不論在何處；
22265,或在明媚樂土，或在死蔭幽谷；
22266,既有救主親自照護，我就不感苦，
22267,處處跟隨耶穌，直到末一步。
22268,我今願跟隨耶穌，不論時何如；
22269,或是陽光滿目，或是黑雲密佈；
22270,既有救主親自部署，我就無所顧，
22271,時時跟隨耶穌，一直到天府。
22272,"Step by step, step by step, I would walk with Jesus,"
22273,"All the day, all the way, Keeping step with Jesus."
22274,步步追，步步隨，步步跟隨耶穌；
22275,天天追，天天隨，天天行走窄路。
22276,"Jesus, I my cross have taken,"
22277,All to leave and follow Thee;
22278,"Destitute, despised, forsaken,"
22279,"Thou from hence, my all shalt be;"
22280,"Perish every fond ambition,"
22281,"All I've sought, and hoped, and known;"
22282,"Yet how rich is my condition,"
22283,God and heav'n are still my own.
22284,"Let the world despise and leave me,"
22285,"They have left my Saviour, too;"
22286,Human hearts and looks deceive me;
22287,"Thou art not, like man, untrue;"
22288,"And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,"
22289,"God of wisdom, love, and might,"
22290,"Foes may hate, and friends may shun me;"
22291,Show Thy face and all is bright.
22292,"Go, then, earthly fame and treasure;"
22293,"Come disaster, scorn, and pain!"
22294,"In Thy service, pain is pleasure;"
22295,"With Thy favour, loss is gain."
22296,"I have called Thee, Abba, Father;"
22297,I have stayed my heart on Thee;
22298,"Storms may howl, and clouds may gather,"
22299,All must work for good to me.
22300,"Man may trouble and distress me,"
22301,'Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
22302,"Life with trials hard may press me,"
22303,Heav'n will bring me sweeter rest.
22304,"O 'tis not in grief to harm me,"
22305,While Thy love is left to me;
22306,"O 'twere not in joy to charm me,"
22307,Were that joy unmixed with Thee.
22308,"Know, my soul, thy full salvation,"
22309,"Rise o'er sin and worldly care,"
22310,"Joy to find in every station,"
22311,Something still to do or bear.
22312,"Think what spirit dwells within thee,"
22313,"What a Father's love is thine,"
22314,"What a Saviour died to win thee,"
22315,"Child of heav'n, should'st thou repine?"
22316,"Haste thee on from grace to glory,"
22317,"Armed by faith, and winged by prayer;"
22318,"Heav'n's eternal day's before thee,"
22319,God's own hand shall guide thee there.
22320,"Soon shall close Thy earthly mission,"
22321,"Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,"
22322,"Hope shall change to glad fruition,"
22323,Faith to sight and prayer to praise.
22324,耶穌，我今撇下所有，
22325,背起十架跟隨你；
22326,甘受藐視、艱苦、恥羞，
22327,心惟歡然作活祭。
22328,前所追求，愛慕、盼望，
22329,一切雄心全敗亡；
22330,但我景況何等寬廣，
22331,仍然有神與天堂。
22332,任憑世界棄我嫌我，
22333,主，你也曾被棄嫌；
22334,人面人心欺我騙我，
22335,惟神永遠不欺騙。
22336,當你向我顯出笑臉，
22337,友雖生疏敵雖險；
22338,我心平安，處之泰然，
22339,因我得見你歡顏。
22340,去罷，罪的名利福樂，
22341,來罷，艱難和諷嘲；
22342,為你生活，失即是得，
22343,有你喜悅，卑也高。
22344,我既稱祂阿爸父親，
22345,我既靠你定我心；
22346,所有狂風，怒雨厚雲，
22347,都成益我的器皿。
22348,我所受的試煉苦痛，
22349,不過驅我到你前；
22350,我的困難壓我愈重，
22351,天上平安愈甘甜。
22352,有何憂愁能將我襲，
22353,當你榮面向我顯？
22354,有何快樂能將我迷，
22355,若你不在它中間？
22356,心哪，當脫恐懼掛慮，
22357,接受完全的救恩；
22358,無論面臨何種境遇，
22359,欣然忍受或前行。
22360,試想：有主作你罪祭，
22361,有父向你顯慈顏，
22362,有靈運行在你心裡，
22363,你是神子何可怨？
22364,快由恩典進入榮耀，
22365,信當籐牌，求當翼，
22366,眼前天國就要破曉，
22367,神必親自領到底。
22368,地上職事就要停止，
22369,人生程途就要完；
22370,盼望就要變成事實，
22371,信變眼見禱變讚。
22372,"I traveled down a lonely road and no one seemed to care,"
22373,The burden on my weary back had bowed me to despair;
22374,"I oft complained to Jesus how folks were treating me,"
22375,And then I heard Him say so tenderly;
22376,"“My feet were also weary upon the Calv'ry road,"
22377,"The cross became so heavy, I fell beneath the load;"
22378,"Be faithful, weary pilgrims, the morning I can see —"
22379,Just lift your cross and follow close to me.”
22380,“I work so hard for Jesus” — I often boast and say-
22381,“I've sacrificed a lot of things to walk the narrow way;
22382,I gave up fame and fortune — I'm worth a lot to Thee!”
22383,And then I hear Him gently say to me:
22384,"“I left the throne of glory, and counted it but loss;"
22385,My hands were nailed in anger upon a cruel cross;
22386,But now we'll make the journey with your hand safe in mine-
22387,So lift your cross and follow close to me.”
22388,"O Jesus, if I die upon a foreign field some day,"
22389,'Twould be no more than love demands — no less could I repay;
22390,“No greater love hath mortal man than for a friend to die” —
22391,These are the words He gently spoke to me:
22392,"“If just a cup of water I place within your hand,"
22393,Then just a cup of water is all that I demand;”
22394,"But if by death to living, they can Thy glory see,"
22395,I'll take my cross and follow close to Thee.
22396,我曾行在孤單路上，擔子重壓肩頭，
22397,痛苦疲乏幾至絕望，竟無人施援手；
22398,我到主座前傾訴所遭無情冷落，
22399,即聞主溫柔聲向我細說：
22400,“我腳何曾不疲乏，踏上加略山道？
22401,十架是這樣沉重，我被壓至仆倒；
22402,疲倦路客要起來，黎明在我掌握，
22403,背起你十架，緊緊跟隨我。“
22404,我常向主得意誇口：“日夜奔波勞苦，
22405,我已犧牲許多事物，為走十架窄路；
22406,名譽、財富全拋棄，身價必值許多。“
22407,然而我聞主柔聲對我說：
22408,“我離開榮耀寶座，捨去天上榮華，
22409,我雙手曾被兵丁怒釘殘酷十架；
22410,將你手交我掌握，前行必得穩妥，
22411,哦，主耶穌，若我一日死於異地、他鄉，
22412,也不會超愛所要求，縱使一切擺上。
22413,“世人的愛莫過於人為朋友捨命。”
22414,這是祂向我低語的聲音：
22415,“若我放在你手中只是一杯涼水，
22416,我向你所有要求不過只這一杯。“
22417,若因我死，而有人見你榮耀國度，
22418,我願背十架，緊緊跟隨主。
22419,"There is sunshine in my soul today,"
22420,"More glorious and bright,"
22421,"Than glows in any earthly sky,"
22422,For Jesus is my light.
22423,"O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,"
22424,"While the peaceful, happy moments roll;"
22425,"When Jesus shows His smiling face,"
22426,There is sunshine in my soul.
22427,"There is music in my soul today,"
22428,A carol to my King;
22429,"And Jesus, listening, can hear"
22430,The songs I cannot sing.
22431,"There is springtime in my soul today,"
22432,"For when the Lord is near,"
22433,"The dove of peace sings in my heart,"
22434,The flow'rs of grace appear.
22435,"There is gladness in my soul today,"
22436,"And hope, and praise, and love,"
22437,"For blessings which He gives me now,"
22438,For joys laid up above.
22439,在我魂間，今天有陽光，
22440,遠勝世界太陽–
22441,更為榮耀、新鮮而輝煌，
22442,因主就是這光。
22443,榮耀之光福樂之光
22444,當我平安喜樂在主前
22445,當主向我顯現衪笑臉
22446,是有光在我魂間
22447,在我魂間，今天有音樂，
22448,頌讚我主不止；
22449,主在聽著，因衪能了解
22450,我唱不出的詩。
22451,在我魂間，今天有春天，
22452,因主與我相愛；
22453,平安之鴿吟詠在裏面，
22454,恩典開花在外。
22455,在我魂間，今天有喜樂，
22456,希望、讚美和愛；
22457,因為現在衪賜我聯合，
22458,將來賜我賞賚。
22459,"I have found a friend in Jesus, He's ev'rything to me,"
22460,He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
22461,"The Lily of the Valley, In Him alone I see,"
22462,All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.
22463,"In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay,"
22464,He tells me ev'ry care on Him to roll;
22465,"He's the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star,"
22466,He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
22467,"He all my griefs has taken, and all my sorrows borne;"
22468,In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower;
22469,"I have all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn"
22470,"From my heart, and now He keeps me by His pow'r,"
22471,"Though all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore,"
22472,Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.
22473,"He will never, never leave me, Nor yet forsake me here,"
22474,While I live by faith and do His blessed will
22475,"A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,"
22476,With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill;
22477,"Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face,"
22478,Where rivers of delight shall ever roll.
22479,主耶穌是我密友﹐又是我的萬有﹐
22480,超乎萬人奪我心坎主無雙﹔
22481,祂是谷中百合花﹐我心單獨愛祂﹐
22482,洗我潔淨﹐使我完全再無瑕。
22483,憂慮祂是我安慰﹔患難有祂抵擋﹐
22484,一切重擔都擔在祂肩上。
22485,祂是明亮的晨星﹐是谷中百合花﹐
22486,超乎萬人奪我心坎主無雙。
22487,主擔我一切憂傷﹐背負我的痛苦﹐
22488,試探來臨﹐祂是我堅固保障﹔
22489,為祂﹐我丟棄萬事﹐驅逐一切偶像﹐
22490,現今蒙祂能力保守何安康。縱然世界嫌棄我﹐
22491,縱然仇敵猖狂﹐
22492,有主﹐仍勇至終點﹐無懼怕。
22493,主永不將我丟棄﹐也不將我撇下﹐
22494,行祂有福旨意﹐因信而生活﹔
22495,祂作我四圍火城﹐我就無所懼怕﹐
22496,饑餓靈魂常因靈糧得飽享。
22497,當我榮耀被提時﹐見祂可頌面容﹐
22498,喜樂河滾滾﹐湧流何久長。
22520,"How tedious and tasteless the hours,"
22521,When Jesus no longer I see!
22522,"Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flow'rs,"
22523,Have all lost their sweetness to me.
22524,"The mid-summer sun shines but dim,"
22525,The fields strive in vain to look gay;
22526,"But when I am happy in Him,"
22527,December's as pleasant as May.
22528,"His name yields the richest perfume,"
22529,And sweeter than music His voice;
22530,"His presence disperses my gloom,"
22531,"And makes all within me rejoice,"
22532,"I should, were He always thus nigh,"
22533,Have nothing to wish or to fear;
22534,No mortal so happy as I;
22535,My summer would last all the year.
22536,"Content with beholding His face,"
22537,My all to His pleasure resigned;
22538,"No changes of season or place,"
22539,Would make any change in my mind.
22540,"While blessed with a sense of His love,"
22541,A palace a toy would appear;
22542,"And prisons would palaces prove,"
22543,If Jesus would dwell with me there.
22544,"My Lord, if indeed I am Thine,"
22545,"If Thou art my sun and my song,"
22546,"Say, why do I languish and pine?"
22547,And why are my winters so long?
22548,"Oh, drive these dark clouds from the sky,"
22549,Thy soul-cheering presence restore;
22550,"Or take me to Thee up on high,"
22551,Where winter and clouds are no more.
22552,當我不見基督容華，
22553,時間何等無味、可厭！
22554,甘甜的鳥甘甜的花，
22555,對我就不再是甘甜；
22556,可愛太陽如失光線，
22557,田野枉欲表現歡喜，
22558,當我快樂在祂裡面，
22559,陰霾也如晴空美麗。
22560,祂名發出最美香味，
22561,祂聲成為最甜音樂；
22562,祂的同在展我愁眉，
22563,使我裡面盡都歡悅。
22564,祂若如此不斷親密，
22565,我就無何可怕、可求；
22566,無人快樂與我可比，
22567,我的春日常年長有。
22568,看見祂面我就甘甜，
22569,我就只求祂的歡喜；
22570,不論時地有何改變，
22571,不能改變我的心意。
22572,只要感覺祂的愛戀，
22573,宮殿也成可笑玩具，
22574,監獄可成榮耀宮殿，
22575,如果基督和我同居。
22576,我主，若我真是屬你，
22577,你若是我詩歌、太陽，
22578,請問為何我仍憂悒？
22579,為何嚴冬這樣久長？
22580,或將黑雲趕離我天，
22581,恢復你的歡樂同在；
22582,或接我到你的面前，
22583,無冬昏昧，無雲靉靆。
22584,"His banner over me is love, His banner over me is love,"
22585,He brought me into His banqueting House
22586,And His banner over me is love.
22587,"Is love, is love, His banner over me is love."
22588,以愛為旗在我以上，以愛為旗在我以上，
22589,祂帶我進入祂的筵宴所，
22590,並以愛為旗在我以上。
22591,以愛，以愛，以愛為旗在我以上，
22652,"Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts, Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men,"
22653,"From the best bliss that earth imparts, We turn unfilled to Thee again."
22654,"Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood, Thou savest those that on Thee call;"
22655,"To them that seek Thee, Thou art good, To them that find Thee, all in all."
22656,"Our restless spirits yearn for Thee, Where'er our changeful lot is cast;"
22657,"Glad when Thy gracious smile we see, Blest when our faith can hold Thee fast."
22658,"O Jesus, ever with us stay, Make all our moments calm and bright;"
22659,"Chase the dark night of sin away, Shed o'er the world Thy holy light."
22660,救主耶穌，愛者之樂，世人之光，生命之歌；
22661,世上福樂我盡撇棄，再帶虛心向你投依。
22662,你是真理，永存不變，凡呼求者必蒙救援，
22663,凡尋求者必能尋見，凡尋見者必蒙恩眷。
22664,不論一生境遇如何，我靈慕主如饑如渴；
22665,見主笑臉我便心悅，以信靠主福樂無缺。
22666,求主耶穌與我同行，時刻賜我平安、光明；
22667,驅除一切罪惡黑影聖潔之光照遍四境。
22668,"Whom have I, Lord, in heav'n but Thee?"
22669,None but Thee! None but Thee!
22670,And this my song thro' life shall be:
22671,Christ for me! Christ for me!
22672,"He hath for me the serpent trod,"
22673,"He hath redeemed me “by His blood,”"
22674,And reconciled my soul to God;
22675,I envy not the rich their joys;
22676,I covet not earth's glitt'ring toys:
22677,"Earth can no lasting bliss bestow,"
22678,“Fading” is stamped on all below;
22679,Mine is a joy no end can know:
22680,Though with the poor be cast my lot:
22681,"“He knoweth best,” I murmur not;"
22682,"Though “vine” and “fig-tree” blight assail,"
22683,"The “labor of the olive fail,”"
22684,And death o'er flock and herd prevail;
22685,"Though I am now on hostile ground,"
22686,"And sin beset me all around,"
22687,"Let earth her fiercest battles wage,"
22688,"And foes against my soul engage,"
22689,Strong in His strength I scorn their rage;
22690,"And when my life draws to its close,"
22691,"Safe in His arms I shall repose,"
22692,"When sharpest pains my frame pervade,"
22693,"And all the powers of nature fade,"
22694,Still will I sing through death's cold shade:
22695,主，我還有誰在天上？
22696,惟有你！惟有你！
22697,我的一生只此可唱：
22698,主為我！主為我！
22699,祂已為我流血辛勞，
22700,祂作我的贖罪羊羔；
22701,使我這人與神和好，
22702,我不追求自私福氣，
22703,我要主！我要主！
22704,我不羨慕鍍金玩意，
22705,自私福氣不能長久，
22706,性質定規瞬息罷休，
22707,我的喜樂永遠存留，
22708,我今棄絕為富思想，
22709,我不盼望自己安享，
22710,無花果樹雖不發旺，
22711,葡萄、橄欖無一可享；
22712,棚內無牛，圈中無羊，
22713,我心現今完全安息，
22714,不怕試探常來攻擊，
22715,任憑引誘力量洶湧，
22716,我們靠主能夠強勇，
22717,能夠冷笑它們無用，
22718,當我人生路程將畢，
22719,安全倚靠祂的手臂，
22720,我的軀殼雖有痛苦，
22721,所有自然力量都無，
22722,我仍高聲歌唱歡呼，
22723,There's a peace in my heart
22724,"That the world never gave,"
22725,A peace it can not take away;
22726,Tho' the trials of life
22727,"May surround like a cloud,"
22728,I've a peace that has come there to stay!
22729,"Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine;"
22730,"Constantly abiding, rapture divine;"
22731,"He never leaves me lonely, whispers O so kind:"
22732,"“I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine."
22733,All the world seemed to sing
22734,"Of a Saviour and King,"
22735,When peace sweetly came to my heart:
22736,Troubles all fled away
22737,"And my night turned to day,"
22738,"Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!"
22739,This treasure I have
22740,"In a temple of clay,"
22741,While here on His footstool I roam;
22742,But He's coming to take
22743,"Me some glorious day,"
22744,Over there to my heavenly home!
22745,有平安在我心，
22746,非世界所能賜，
22747,這平安無人能奪去；
22748,雖一生多試煉，
22749,如愁雲環繞我，
22750,這平安永遠住在我心。
22751,永遠住在我心，耶穌屬我；
22752,永遠住在我心，無窮喜樂；
22753,祂永不會離棄我，慈聲對我說：
22754,“我永不離棄你，”耶穌屬我。
22755,全世界都洋溢
22756,我救主君王頌，
22757,當平安甘甜滿我心；
22758,眾愁苦皆逃避，
22759,使黑夜變白晝，
22760,何榮耀，何有福，我耶穌！
22761,我已有“這珍寶，”
22762,深藏我心殿中，
22763,正當流浪崎嶇世途；
22764,哦，榮耀之大日，
22765,祂必來提我去，
22766,平安回到我天父家中。
22829,"I've found a refuge from life's care in Jesus,"
22830,I am hiding in His love divine;
22831,"He fully understands my soul's deep longing,"
22832,"And He whispers softly, “Thou art mine.”"
22833,Only Jesus! Only Jesus! Only He can satisfy;
22834,"Ev'ry burden becomes a blessing, when I know my Lord is nigh."
22835,"I've found a precious joy in knowing Jesus,"
22836,Never dreamed of in this world of woe;
22837,"No clouds, however dark, can dim the radiance"
22838,Of the heav'nly light He doth bestow.
22839,"I've found a blessed hope divine in Jesus,"
22840,'Tis a Day Star ever shining bright;
22841,"It fills my earthly way with heav'nly glory,"
22842,And it turns life's darkness into light.
22843,我已尋獲主耶穌作避難所，
22844,在祂愛中，我得享穩妥；
22845,祂完全領會我深處的饑渴，
22846,就柔聲對我說：“你屬我！”
22847,惟有耶穌，惟有耶穌，惟有祂使我滿足;
22848,當我知道有我主親近，一切重擔變祝福。
22849,我已尋獲主耶穌作我喜樂，
22850,愁苦世人從夢想不到；
22851,儘管烏雲再黑，也不能掩遮
22852,祂賜屬天光輝的榮耀。
22853,我已尋獲主耶穌作我盼望，
22854,有如旭日越照越明朗；
22855,叫我在地路程滿了天榮光，
22856,所有人生幽暗變光亮。
22857,Hallelujah! I have found Him Whom my soul so long has craved!
22858,"Jesus satisfies my longings, Thro' His life I now am saved."
22859,哈利路亞！我尋得祂–我靈久慕，心所求；
22860,耶穌滿足我所缺乏，藉祂生命我得救。
22861,"Jesus my Lord will love me forever,"
22862,"From Him no pow'r of evil can sever,"
22863,"He gave His life to ransom my soul,"
22864,Now I belong to Him.
22865,"Now I belong to Jesus, Jesus belongs to me,"
22866,"Not for the years of time alone, But for eternity."
22867,"Once I was lost in sin's degradation,"
22868,"Jesus came down to bring me salvation,"
22869,"Lifted me up from sorrow and shame,"
22870,"Joy floods my soul for Jesus has saved me,"
22871,"Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me,"
22872,"His precious blood He gave to redeem,"
22873,耶穌我救主愛我無止息，
22874,無權勢能叫我與主分離，
22875,為救贖我捨命於十架，
22876,我今永遠屬祂。
22877,我今屬於主耶穌，主耶穌也屬我，
22878,並非暫時與祂結聯，乃是直到永遠。
22879,從前在罪中我迷醉浮沉，
22880,耶穌降世為我帶來救恩；
22881,拯救我脫離羞恥、懼怕，
22882,喜樂溢我魂，因我蒙拯救；
22883,前我為罪奴，今得主自由；
22884,為救贖我，祂寶血流下，
22885,Fairest Lord Jesus!
22886,"Ruler of all nature,"
22887,O Thou of God and man the Son!
22888,"Thee will I cherish,"
22889,"Thee will I honour,"
22890,"Thou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown!"
22891,"Fair are the meadows,"
22892,"Fairer still the woodlands,"
22893,Robed in the blooming garb of spring:
22894,"Jesus is fairer,"
22895,"Jesus is purer,"
22896,Who makes the woeful heart to sing.
22897,"Fair is the sunshine,"
22898,"Fairer still the moonlight,"
22899,And all the twinkling starry host:
22900,"Jesus shines brighter,"
22901,"Jesus shines purer,"
22902,Than all the angels heav'n can boast.
22903,"All scenes of beauty,"
22904,"All on earth, above the sky,"
22905,"Are to be found, O Lord, in Thee."
22906,"None can be brighter,"
22907,"None can be sweeter,"
22908,"Than Jesus, Lord, Thou art to me."
22909,美哉，主耶穌，
22910,統管宇宙萬物，
22911,道成肉身，人世親臨；
22912,我心所珍愛，
22913,我靈所感戴，
22914,我的榮耀、冠冕、歡欣！
22915,草地何青綠！
22916,樹木更加悅目！
22917,披著春光盛開爭艷！
22918,耶穌更鮮艷！
22919,耶穌更香甜！
22920,傷痛之心因祂歡讚。
22921,日光何晴美！
22922,月光更加明媚！
22923,群星閃爍，光輝奪目，
22924,耶穌更明亮！
22925,耶穌更晴朗！
22926,勝過天上一切景物！
22927,所有的美麗，
22928,在天或是在地，
22929,在你身上全都見到；
22930,無何更光彩！
22931,無何更可愛！
22932,惟我救主，你最高超！
22933,"Fade, fade, each earthly joy, Jesus is mine."
22934,Break ev'ry tender tie; Jesus is mine.
22935,"Dark is the wilderness, Earth has no resting place,"
22936,Jesus alone can bless; Jesus is mine.
22937,Tempt not my soul away; Jesus is mine.
22938,Here would I ever stay; Jesus is mine.
22939,"Perishing things of clay, Born but for one brief day,"
22940,Pass from my heart away; Jesus is mine.
22941,"Farewell, ye dreams of night; Jesus is mine."
22942,Lost in this dawning bright; Jesus is mine.
22943,All that my soul has tried left but a dismal void;
22944,Jesus has satisfied; Jesus is mine.
22945,"Farewell, mortality; Jesus is mine."
22946,"Welcome, eternity; Jesus is mine."
22947,"Welcome, O Loved and Blest, Welcome, sweet scenes of rest,"
22948,"Welcome, my Saviour's breast; Jesus is mine."
22949,今世福樂沒滅，基督屬我！
22950,地上愛情斷絕，基督屬我！
22951,在此幽暗野地，無處可以安息，
22952,惟有基督可倚，基督屬我！
22953,莫誘我心離開，基督屬我！
22954,我願與主同在，基督屬我！
22955,你這今世歡娛，一時騙人之局，
22956,從我心中離去，基督屬我！
22957,去罷，今世幻夢，基督屬我！
22958,我今已經清醒，基督屬我！
22959,凡我從前所慕，不過使我痛苦；
22960,惟主使我滿足，基督屬我！
22961,去罷，短暫今時，基督屬我！
22962,來罷，長久永世，基督屬我！
22963,來罷，可愛福氣！來罷，甜美安息！
22964,來罷，恩主自己！基督屬我！
22985,世上那有一人像你，真能滿足我心？
22986,我得著你如同至寶，勝過千萬金銀。
23002,"O Thou, in whose presence my soul takes delight,"
23003,"On whom in affliction I call,"
23004,"My comfort by day and my song in the night,"
23005,"My hope, my salvation, my all!"
23006,"Where dost Thou, dear Shepherd, resort with Thy sheep,"
23007,To feed them in pastures of love;
23008,"Say, why in the valley of death should I weep,"
23009,Or alone in this wilderness rove?
23010,"Oh, why should I wander, an alien from Thee,"
23011,Or cry in the desert for bread?
23012,"Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,"
23013,And smile at the tears I have shed.
23014,"Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have you seen"
23015,The Star that on Israel shone?
23016,"Say, if in your tents my Beloved has been,"
23017,And where with His flocks He is gone?
23018,"He looks! And ten thousands of angels rejoice,"
23019,And myriads wait for His word;
23020,"He speaks! And eternity, filled with His voice,"
23021,Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.
23022,"Dear Shepherd! I hear, and will follow Thy call;"
23023,I know the sweet sound of Thy voice;
23024,"Restore and defend me, for Thou art my all,"
23025,And in Thee I will ever rejoice.
23026,主阿，在你面前我心何其樂！
23027,遭難時你懷中可投；
23028,我白晝之安慰，我黑夜之歌，
23029,我指望，我救主，我友！
23030,哎，親愛的牧者去那裏放羊？
23031,以愛領到那塊草地？
23032,為何我在死蔭之幽谷心傷？
23033,為何我在曠野飲泣？
23034,為何我要飄流而遠離了你？
23035,在沙漠中哭號求肉？
23036,你仇敵一見我流淚必暗喜，
23037,必笑我因貪食淚流。
23038,問錫安眾女子，請妳告訴我，
23039,有否看見雅各之星？
23040,我良人曾否由妳帳棚經過？
23041,祂何處將羊群前領？
23042,阿，良人一舉目，眾天使下拜，
23043,祂面前有萬軍敬候；
23044,我良人一開口，全宇宙傳開，
23045,到永遠應聲讚美主。
23046,最親愛的牧者，我來跟隨你，
23047,我認得你召我美音；
23048,求甦醒我靈魂，惟你合我意，
23049,惟你常常滿足我心。
23050,住在主裏面，無上的福氣，
23051,常與主交通，甜美的經歷；
23052,住在主裏面，主與我聯合，
23053,常與主交通，與主無間隔。
23054,住在主裏面，恩膏必運行，
23055,常與主交通，聖靈必引領；
23056,順服主恩膏，得享主肥甘，
23057,跟隨主聖靈，必作主同伴。
23058,住在主裏面，恩光必照明，
23059,常與主交通，黑影必除淨；
23060,思光一順從，生命必增長，
23061,黑影全脫離，心靈纔舒暢。
23062,住在主裏面，軟弱變剛強，
23063,常與主交通，生命吞死亡；
23064,住在主裏面，歎息變歌唱，
23065,常與主交通，喜樂代憂傷。
23066,住在主裏面，撒但難攻擊，
23067,常與主交通，世界失吸力；
23068,住在主裏面，罪惡無權勢，
23069,常與主交通，自己必消逝。
23070,住在主裏面，模成主榮形，
23071,常與主交通，充滿主生命；
23072,住在主裏面，經歷主大能，
23073,常與主交通，吸取主豐盛。
23074,住在主裏面，心靈在渴慕，
23075,常與主交通，聖靈在催促；
23076,惟願我全人浸在主裏面，
23077,與主溶為一，從今到永遠。
23078,Abide in Thee! in that deep love of Thine.
23079,"My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine;"
23080,"Down, closely down, as living branch with tree."
23081,"I would abide my Lord, my Christ, in Thee."
23082,"Abide in Thee! my Saviour God, I know"
23083,"How Love of Thine so vast in me may flow,"
23084,"My empty vessel, running o'er with joy."
23085,Must overflow to Thee without alloy.
23086,"Abide in Thee! nor doubt, nor self, nor sin,"
23087,Can e'er prevail with Thy blest life within;
23088,"Joined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul"
23089,Knows naught besides its motions to control.
23090,Abide in Thee! 'tis thus I only know
23091,The secrets of Thy mind e'en while below —
23092,"All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy word,"
23093,"All pow'r and fruit, and service for the Lord."
23094,住在祢裏面這是我心願，
23095,住在祢裏面時刻不間斷；
23096,枝子如何與葡萄樹相聯，
23097,主我也深願住在祢裏面。
23098,住在祢裏面享受祢豐富，
23099,祢所是一切得藉我流露；
23100,願作祢身上常新的枝子，
23101,彰顯祢生命結果永不止。
23102,住在祢裏面罪己失權能，
23103,再無法勝過祢內住生命；
23104,與祢相結聯深處互交通，
23105,靈就能管治魂一切活動。
23106,住在祢裏面得知祢心意，
23107,摸著祢同在進入祢祕密；
23108,喜樂與平安要將我充溢，
23109,祢話的供應也作我能力。
23110,"Within His secret place I hide,"
23111,"Under His shadow I abide,"
23112,"For by His blood I've entered in,"
23113,"Heaven is bowed, glory is seen;"
23114,"His royal train o'er me is spread,"
23115,My heart exults a new song glad.
23116,"O Lord, I know I'm tasting heaven here,"
23117,"No other longing do I now hold dear,"
23118,Love like sea billows roll
23119,"Flooding over my soul,"
23120,"Yes, Lord, I know in heav'n I'm dwelling here."
23121,"Exalted on the throne of grace,"
23122,He bids me gaze upon His face.
23123,"His train like living water flows,"
23124,Giving me shelter and repose.
23125,The oil of joy He e'er bestows;
23126,"My soul o'erflows, my hear extols."
23127,His dazzling glory makes me bow;
23128,His grace has won my homage now.
23129,"I've seen His kingdom and I shout,"
23130,Here sin and death are put to rout!
23131,"Love, hope e'er fresh, faith soaring high."
23132,Heaven is bowed — glory is nigh!
23133,在至高者的隱密處，
23134,在全能者的手蔭下；
23135,我靠寶血得以進入，
23136,在彼諸天榮耀下降；
23137,救主衣裳將我遮藏，
23138,我心歡樂我靈歌唱。
23139,哦，主，我已在此嘗到天堂，
23140,我心已經再無別的盼望；
23141,愛如浪潮滾滾，
23142,陣陣漫我心魂，
23143,我知現今我正住在天堂。
23144,救主高踞施恩寶座，
23145,召我進前瞻仰君王；
23146,衣裳垂下，活水流淌，
23147,賜我護庇，賜我安康；
23148,喜樂的油親注頭上，
23149,我魂滿溢，何等歡暢。
23150,榮耀重重使我俯伏，
23151,恩典浩大迫我順服；
23152,天國勝景我已目睹，
23153,罪勢、死權盡都消失；
23154,愛望常新，信心飛揚，
23155,你已使天榮耀下降。
23156,"There is a place of quiet rest, Near to the heart of God,"
23157,"A place where sin cannot molest, Near to the heart of God."
23158,"O Jesus, blest Redeemer, Sent from the heart of God,"
23159,"Hold us, who wait before Thee, Near to the heart of God."
23160,"There is a place of comfort sweet, Near to the heart of God,"
23161,"A place where we our Saviour meet, Near to the heart of God."
23162,"There is a place of full release, Near to the heart of God,"
23163,"A place where all is joy and peace, Near to the heart of God."
23164,有一安靜隱密之處，靠近父神懷中；
23165,在彼罪惡不能侵襲，靠近父神懷中。
23166,主耶穌，親愛救主，降自父神懷中；
23167,求主使我得能力，靠近父神懷中！
23168,有一甘甜安慰之處，靠近父神懷中；
23169,在彼我們與主相會，靠近父神懷中。
23170,有一自由釋放之處，靠近父神懷中；
23171,在彼充滿喜樂平安，靠近父神懷中。
23172,Under His wings I am safely abiding;
23173,"Tho' the night deepens and tempests are wild,"
23174,"Still I can trust Him, I know He will keep me;"
23175,"He has redeemed me, and I am His child."
23176,"Under His wings, Under His wings, Who from His love can sever?"
23177,"Under His wings my soul shall abide, Safely abide for ever."
23178,Under His wings — what a refuge in sorrow!
23179,How the heart yearningly turns to His rest!
23180,"Often when earth has no balm for my healing,"
23181,"There I find comfort, and there I am blest."
23182,"Under His wings — oh, what precious enjoyment!"
23183,There will I hide till life's trials are o'er;
23184,"Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;"
23185,Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.
23186,在衪翼下，平安穩妥我居住，
23187,不管夜色多深，且有風雨；
23188,但我能信靠，我知祂必眷顧，
23189,因祂已救我，我是祂兒女。
23190,在衪翼下，在衪翼下，誰能使我離祂愛！
23191,在衪翼下，這是我的家，我必與主永同在。
23192,在衪翼下，我能躲過我憂傷，
23193,我心滿足，我能在此安歇；
23194,世上並無膏油可治我病創，
23195,在此我得祝福，我得慰藉。
23196,在衪翼下，何等寶貴的享受！
23197,一生在此，直到試煉過去；
23198,有主保護蔭庇，無何再添愁，
23199,安息於主，我是永遠無虞。
23200,"O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,"
23201,My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
23202,"So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be;"
23203,"Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I'm hiding in Thee."
23204,"Hiding in Thee, Hiding in Thee,"
23205,"In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,"
23206,In times when temptation casts o'er me its power;
23207,"In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,"
23208,"How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,"
23209,I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe;
23210,"How often, when trials like seabillows roll,"
23211,"Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul."
23212,在憂傷、痛苦、危險四圍之時，
23213,我要飛至更高磐石得安息；
23214,雖然常跌倒、軟弱，我仍屬祢，
23215,祢是“永久磐石，”我藏身主裏。
23216,藏身主裏，藏身主裏，
23217,祢是“永久磐石，”我藏身主裏。
23218,有時歷平順，有時孤單難忍，
23219,有時遭試煉如波浪猛沖擊，
23220,人生的風波如海濤湧不息，
23221,有時遇仇敵壓迫，竭盡全力，
23222,我立磐石上，勝過四面仇敵；
23223,我心得安穩，雖有風雨襲擊，
23224,"“Within the Veil:” Be this, belov'd, thy portion,"
23225,Within the secret of Thy Lord to dwell;
23226,"Beholding Him, until thy face His glory,"
23227,"Thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell."
23228,"“Within the Veil,” for only as thou gazest"
23229,"Upon the matchless beauty of His face,"
23230,Canst thou become a living revelation
23231,"Of His great heart of love, His untold grace."
23232,"“Within the Veil,” His fragrance poured upon thee,"
23233,"Without the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad;"
23234,"“Within the Veil,” His hand shall tune the music"
23235,Which sounds on earth the praises of thy Lord.
23236,"“Within the Veil,” thy spirit deeply anchored,"
23237,Thou walkest calm above a world of strife;
23238,"“Within the Veil” thy soul with Him united,"
23239,Shall live on earth His resurrection life.
23240,“進入幔內，”願這福分你珍藏，
23241,永遠居住至高者隱密處；
23242,瞻祂榮臉，至你反映祂榮光，
23243,至你生命成祂愛的流露。
23244,“進入幔內，”惟在此至聖之殿，
23245,方能注視祂無比的榮美；
23246,你纔可能成為祂活的彰顯，
23247,祂愛的泱漭，祂恩的廣沛。
23248,“進入幔內，”祂馨香將你熏浸，
23249,出到幔外，流露祂的香味；
23250,“進入幔內，”祂親手調弦定音，
23251,使你在地奏出祂的讚美。
23252,“進入幔內，”你魂已拋錨天界，
23253,使你在世超越紛亂之境；
23254,“進入幔內，”你靈與祂緊聯結，
23255,使你在地活出復活生命。
23256,Abide with me: fast falls the even tide;
23257,"The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!"
23258,"When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,"
23259,"Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!"
23260,Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
23261,"Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;"
23262,Change and decay in all around I see;
23263,"O Thou, Who changest not, abide with me!"
23264,"Come not in terrors, as the King of kings;"
23265,"But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;"
23266,"Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;"
23267,"Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me."
23268,I need Thy presence every passing hour;
23269,What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
23270,Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
23271,"Through cloud and sunshine, Oh, abide with me."
23272,"I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;"
23273,"Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;"
23274,"Where is death's sting? where grave, thy victory?"
23275,"I triumph still, if Thou abide with me."
23276,Be Thou Thyself before my closing eyes;
23277,"Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;"
23278,"Heav'ns morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee."
23279,"In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!"
23280,與我同住，夕陽西沉迅速，
23281,黑暗漸深，求主與我同住；
23282,安慰消逝，其他幫助俱無，
23283,無助之助，求祢與我同住。
23284,人生短日，轉瞬就已昏暮，
23285,我樂漸殘，我的榮耀漸枯；
23286,四境所見盡是變遷朽腐，
23287,永不變者，求來與我同住。
23288,莫帶威嚴，有如王中之王，
23289,只帶慈惠，並祢施醫翅膀；
23290,淚來洗憂，心來聽我求訴，
23291,罪人之友，請來與我同住。
23292,祢的同在，時時我都需要，
23293,除祢恩典，何能使魔敗逃；
23294,有誰像祢，將我引導扶助，
23295,或陰或晴，求祢與我同住。
23296,有你賜福，我就不怕受攻，
23297,病而不苦，流淚也不酸痛；
23298,甚麼毒鉤！甚麼死亡墳墓！
23299,依然勝過，若祢與我同住。
23300,我正閉目，願你在我身邊，
23301,照明幽地，指我向著諸天；
23302,天晨破曉，夜影消散盡無，
23303,或生或死，求主與我同住。
23304,"Lord, make me willing."
23305,"Lord, make me willing,"
23306,"Willing to yield to Thy blessed will,"
23307,Willing to please Thee what-e'er the ill.
23308,Willing to crown Thee my Lord and King.
23309,"Lord, I am willing."
23310,"Lord, I am willing,"
23311,"Willing to crown Thee my Lord and King,"
23312,主，使我願意，
23313,願意甘心順服祢美意，
23314,討祢心歡不論境多逆。
23315,願意冠祢為王尊無比，
23316,主，使我願意。
23317,主，我今願意，
23318,主，我今願意。

23405,"Can you be obedient, To the Lord you serve,"
23406,"Never even flinch, friend, Never even swerve;"
23407,Though your next step onward Seems to lead to death?
23408,Can you then obey Him Without bated breath?
23409,Can you trust your Leader When He bids you go
23410,Right into a battle With a mighty foe?
23411,Can you step up briskly And with joy obey?
23412,"Can you fight the battle, Till the end of day?"
23413,"Can you? The beloved, God just waits for you;"
23414,"Listen for His orders, Glad His will to do;"
23415,"Then when soldiers muster, At the set of sun,"
23416,"And your name is mentioned Christ will say, “Well done.”"
23417,你們能否順從你一切的主，
23418,如果地要震動，天象要翻覆？
23419,你們能否相信，神與你同在，
23420,就是災禍忽臨，必定不見害？
23421,你們能否順從所事奉的主，
23422,不稍軟弱、驚恐，也不稍讓步？
23423,雖然你的前途好像是死路，
23424,此時能否順服，而不一自顧？
23425,你真能否順從，如果主召你
23426,加入前線進攻，抵禦兇仇敵？
23427,你真能否立前，歡喜受差遣？
23428,你真能否爭戰，直到晚色偏？
23429,能否？我的弟兄，你神已久等；
23430,應當服祂權柄，遵行祂命令。
23431,你若作主精兵，當祂再降臨，
23432,祂要題起你名，並說，“你忠心！”
23478,"My dearest Lord didst die for me at Calv'ry,"
23479,What matchless love! How dare I to draw back?
23480,Fix Thou my eyes upon Thy Cross of glory;
23481,Help me press on boldly Thy steps to retrack.
23482,親愛的主，祢曾為我釘十架；
23483,如此恩愛，我豈敢往後退？
23484,求主使我注目仰望主十架；
23485,輕看世界名利，勇敢往前追！
23486,"If Thou shouldst take my love away, Give me Thyself, I pray."
23487,"If Thou shouldst let me be misjudged, Give me Thyself today."
23488,"Lord Jesus, blessed Saviour, More of Thyself I need."
23489,"To Thee I now surrender, “More of Thyself!” I plead."
23490,"If Thou shouldst let my hope be blurred, Give me Thyself, I pray."
23491,"If Thou shouldst let me be disturbed, Give me Thyself today."
23492,"If Thou shouldst take my trust away, Give me Thyself, I pray."
23493,"If Thou shouldst now my pray'r refuse, Give me Thyself today."
23494,"If I should need to more endure, Still give Thyself, I pray."
23495,"If Thy return will be delayed, I need Thyself today."
23496,祢若取去我的心愛，求以自己給我；
23497,祢若仍定我受疑猜，求以自己給我。
23498,主耶穌，親愛救主，多以自己給我；
23499,我向祢完全順服，多以自己給我。
23500,祢使我的望星迷糊，求以自己給我；
23501,祢許我的心緒起伏，求以自己給我。
23502,祢既拆毀我所倚靠，求以自己給我；
23503,祢既拒絕我的禱告，求以自己給我。
23504,我若需要仍舊忍耐，仍以自己給我；
23505,祢若尚未立即再來，再加自己給我。
23506,"My Jesus, as Thou wilt! Oh, may Thy will be mine!"
23507,Into Thy hand of love I would my all resign;
23508,"Thro' sorrow, or thro' joy, conduct me as Thine own,"
23509,"And help me still to say, My Lord, Thy will be done!"
23510,"My Jesus, as Thou wilt! Though seen through many a tear,"
23511,Let not my star of hope Grow dim or disappear;
23512,"Since Thou on earth hast wept, And sorrowed oft alone,"
23513,"If I must weep with Thee, My Lord, Thy will be done!"
23514,"My Jesus, as Thou wilt! All shall be well for me;"
23515,Each changing future scene I gladly trust with Thee.
23516,Straight to Thy rest above I travel calmly on.
23517,"And sing, in life or death, My Lord, Thy will be done!"
23518,主阿，照祢旨意，願我能以順服！
23519,在祢愛的手裏，凡事我都聽主；
23520,歷憂或是歷樂，領我沒有歎聲，
23521,助我仍能來歌：主，祢旨意得成。
23522,主阿，照祢旨意，莫容我的望星
23523,因被淚眼所迷，失蹤或是失明！
23524,祢既在世痛苦，也曾流淚傷心；
23525,若須與祢同哭，主，祢旨意得成。
23526,主阿，照祢旨意，一切都是美好；
23527,每一變化境地，歡然交祢引導。
23528,方寸純全無障，向前直趨天城；
23529,或生或死常唱：主，祢旨意得成。
23530,"""No!"" to the will of the devil,"
23531,"""Yes!"" to the will of the Lord,"

23534,"With Thine authority clothe me,"
23535,"Now, as I stand in Thy will,"

23550,我對撒但總是說﹕“不﹐”
23551,我對父神就說﹕“是﹐”
23552,好叫我主所有部署﹐
23553,全得成功不受阻。
23554,當我這樣聽主號令﹐
23555,求主賜給我權柄﹐
23556,使我滿有能力聖靈﹐
23557,成功主永遠定命。
23558,這個是我永遠態度﹐
23559,求神施恩加扶持。
23560,不然當我實行順服﹐
23561,撒但就要攔去路﹔
23562,當我正在聽祢吩咐﹐
23563,主耶穌﹐求祢看顧！
23564,我願完全絕對順服﹐
23565,不論如何受損失。
23566,當我與主同前時候﹐
23567,主若肯拯救保守﹐
23568,無論甚麼威脅、引誘﹐
23569,不會使我一回頭。
23570,"The path that I have trod, Has bro't me nearer God,"
23571,Tho' oft it led thro' sorrow's gates.
23572,"Tho' not the way I'd choose, In my way I might lose"
23573,The joy that yet for me awaits.
23574,"Not what I wish to be, Nor where I wish to go,"
23575,For who am I that I should choose my way?
23576,"The Lord shall choose for me, 'Tis better far, I know,"
23577,"So let Him bid me go, or stay."
23578,"The cross that I must bear, If I a crown would wear,"
23579,Is not the cross that I should take;
23580,"But, since on me 'tis laid, I'll take it, unafraid,"
23581,And bear it for the Master's sake.
23582,Submission to the will Of Him who guides me still
23583,Is surety of His love revealed;
23584,My soul shall rise above This world in which I move;
23585,I conquer only where I yield.
23586,我所經過道路，雖然滿佈痛苦，
23587,欲是引我更近天父；
23588,雖非我願選擇，但若行走己路，
23589,我將喪失天樂無窮。
23590,非我願作何事，非我願去何地，
23591,我是何人，竟敢選擇己路！
23592,救主為我揀選，這是好得無比，
23593,去留只願遵主命令。
23594,若只為得冠冕，使我去負十架，
23595,十架就失該有價值；
23596,既為主所頒賜，我就背負無懼，
23597,負架原因只為我主。
23598,惟我順服神旨，主愛必然充溢，
23599,一路既由祂手引領；
23600,主將我心高舉，遠超所居之世，
23601,順服，立見完全得勝。
23602,"Do not yield Thy way to mine, Soon I'll yield my will to Thine."
23603,"Let me change my view and way, Dear Lord, to obey."
23604,主阿，祢不可讓步，遲早我是要順服；
23605,讓我改變我意圖–主阿！來順服。
23606,The way of the cross means sacrifice
23607,"As to God you yield your all,"
23608,"To be laid on the altar, the place of death,"
23609,Where fire will surely fall.
23610,'Tis the way of the cross — are you willing for this?
23611,What does bearing the cross mean to you?
23612,"You who've given yourself, your all to God,"
23613,To God are you wholly true?
23614,"As the voice of song and prayer we raise,"
23615,How easy to say“we give all”
23616,Till some rougher cross lies just before
23617,And sterner is duty's call.
23618,"Do you falter then, or true to death"
23619,"Just die on the cross in the way,"
23620,Till the fullness of life from the Loving One
23621,Is filling you day by day?
23622,"'Tis the plan of life, for you die to live,"
23623,One with Jesus crucified;
23624,With the life alone to be lived thro' you
23625,"Of the risen, the glorified."
23626,Look not at your gains or at your loss
23627,But take heed to the will of God.
23628,"Let us look upon all things as worthless dross,"
23629,The steps of the Lord to follow.
23630,十字架的道路要犧牲﹐
23631,要將一切獻於神﹔
23632,將一切放在死的祭壇上面﹐
23633,火纔在這裏顯現。
23634,這是十架道路﹗你願否走這個?
23635,你曾否背十架為你主?
23636,你這奉獻一切給神的人﹗
23637,對神你是否全貞?
23638,當我們唱詩禱告時候﹐
23639,何等願說“獻所有﹗”
23640,但前面有更沉重的十字架﹗
23641,有更艱難的生涯﹗
23642,你要變節﹔或忠心到死﹐
23643,讓一切完全損失﹐
23644,直等到永活主的豐盛生命
23645,天天充滿在你靈﹖
23646,神的救法是由死得生
23647,-你與主合為一人-
23648,在十架﹐你因信已與祂同釘﹐
23649,從你身活出祂命。
23650,我們的得失並不要緊﹐
23651,神的旨意當留心﹔
23652,我們若將萬事都看如糞土﹐
23653,主纔不會受攔阻。
23654,Let me love and not be respected; Let me serve and not be rewarded;
23655,Let me labor and not be remembered;
23656,Let me suffer and not be regarded.
23657,"'Tis the pouring, not the drinking; 'Tis the breaking, not the keeping-"
23658,"A life suff'ring to seek other's blessing,"
23659,A life loving and true comfort giving.
23660,"Not expecting pity and concern, Not accepting solace and applause;"
23661,"Even lonely, even forgotten, Even wordless, even forsaken."
23662,Tears and blood my price for the righteous crown shall be;
23663,"Losing all, my cost for a faithful pilgrim's life."
23664,"'Twas the life, O Lord, that you chose to live"
23665,"In those days when on earth you walked,"
23666,Gladly suff'ring all injuries and loss
23667,So that all might draw near and repose.
23668,I cannot see how much farther I shall go;
23669,"Still I press on, knowing there is no return."
23670,"Let me follow your pattern so perfect and true,"
23671,Bearing in gratitudes without complaint.
23672,"In this time of trial, O my Lord, I pray"
23673,That you'd wipe all my hidden tears away;
23674,"Let me learn, O Lord, you are my reward,"
23675,Let me be others' blessing all my days.
23676,讓我愛而不受感戴，讓我事而不受賞賜；
23677,讓我盡力而不被人記，
23678,讓我受苦而不被人睹。
23679,只知傾酒，不知飲酒；只想擘餅，不想留餅。
23680,倒出生命來使人得幸福，
23681,捨棄安寧而使人得舒服。
23682,不受體恤，不受眷顧，不受推崇，不受安撫；
23683,寧可淒涼，寧可孤苦，寧可無告，寧可被負。
23684,願意以血淚作為冠冕的代價，
23685,願意受虧損來度旅客的生涯。
23686,因為當祢活在這裡時，
23687,祢也是如此過日子，
23688,欣然忍受一切的損失
23689,好使近祢的人得安適。
23690,我今不知前途究有多遠，
23691,這條道路一去就不再還原；
23692,所以讓我學習祢那樣的完全，
23693,時常被人辜負心不生怨。
23694,求祢在這慘淡時期之內，
23695,擦乾我一切暗中的眼淚；
23696,學習知道祢是我的安慰，
23697,並求別人喜悅以度此歲。
23698,"In the cross of Christ I glory,"
23699,Tow'ring o'er the wrecks of time;
23700,"All the light of sacred story,"
23701,Gathers round its head sublime.
23702,"When the woes of life o'ertake me,"
23703,"Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,"
23704,Never shall the cross forsake me;
23705,Lo! it glows with peace and joy.
23706,When the sun of bliss is beaming
23707,"Light and love upon my way,"
23708,From the cross the radiance streaming
23709,Adds more luster to the day.
23710,"Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,"
23711,By the cross are sanctified;
23712,"Peace is there that knows no measure,"
23713,Joys that through all time abide.
23714,All the light of sacred story
23715,主十字架是我誇耀，
23716,年代滅沒它獨存；
23717,神聖事蹟光輝環繞，
23718,十架巍然是中心。
23719,當我遭遇患難折磨，
23720,希望成空，憂懼纏；
23721,主十字架永不棄我，
23722,看哪！喜樂與平安。
23723,福樂太陽，以光以愛
23724,照耀在我道路上；
23725,主十字架放射光彩，
23726,使我人生更光亮。
23727,是禍是福，是苦是樂，
23728,十字架全使成聖；
23729,在此平安深廣莫測，
23730,喜樂永遠不變更。
23731,"The cross of Christ shall ever be my boast and pride,"
23732,"Tho' there be times the heavy weight seems hard to bear,"
23733,But long has since this pilgrim journey testified:
23734,"Only the cross can heal the wound of deep despair,"
23735,Sparrows can find a place of quiet rest;
23736,Swallows can build for their young ones a nest.
23737,"Now by the cross I have come thro' this heav'nly gate,"
23738,Therefore my heart is filled with peace and songs of praise!
23739,"Tho' there be times tears from within may dim my eyes,"
23740,"But in this vale, a spring shall flow to calm my sighs;"
23741,"For Thou art mine, my strength, my heart, my very life."
23742,"Yes, Lord, through these summer and winter times,"
23743,Oh what contentment filled with mirth is mine.
23744,Trusting the cross shall be my cause for endless joy;
23745,Therefore my heart shall bless Thy name with cheerful voice!
23746,"Tho' there be times my feet be burned from painful strides,"
23747,But here I hear Thy tender voice so sweetly guides;
23748,Only the cross gives shelter in this desert land.
23749,How fresh and clear Thy spring with ease has flown.
23750,"Drink to the full, O dry and weary soul!"
23751,Drawn to the cross my strength can be revived once more;
23752,Therefore my heart shall flood with praises evermore!
23753,Tho' there be times my heart's so burdened with complaints.
23754,"Suddenly then, Thy glory 'fore my eyes appears;"
23755,The cross now brings me to behold Thee face to face.
23756,And there I kiss the imprint of Thy feet;
23757,Thy every step has paved a path for me.
23758,"O blessed cross, Thy glory has now filled my heart;"
23759,Therefore I sing for I have won the crown of Life!
23760,救主十架永遠是我誇耀原因，
23761,雖然有時屈身喘息力不能勝；
23762,但是長久旅居經歷已足證明，
23763,惟有十架能醫一切心靈傷痕。
23764,麻雀在彼找到安息之所，
23765,燕子在彼找到抱雛之窩；
23766,經過十架我已達到通天之門，
23767,在此我心充滿安息感激聲音。
23768,雖然有時心肉衰殘，淚眼不明；
23769,但你是我心中力量，心中生命，
23770,流淚谷中活泉湧流慰我衷心。
23771,哦主我的在世旅居寒暑，
23772,在此充滿何等甘甜滿足；
23773,依靠十架乃是無窮喜樂原因，
23774,在此我心歡樂反覆稱頌主名。
23775,雖然有時旅足紅熱疼痛難行；
23776,在此我聞聖靈溫柔指引聲音，
23777,惟有十架乃是炎熱沙地涼亭。
23778,祢的清涼活泉在此流奔，
23779,飲我枯萎心田甦我疲魂；
23780,就近十架我常獲得能力充盈，
23781,在此我心浸於甘源讚美不停！
23782,雖然有時心頹力竭難免呻吟；
23783,倦眼忽見榮光一閃來自天庭，
23784,十架今正帶我進入榮耀之境。
23785,我要低頭吻你痛苦腳印，
23786,每一腳印都成通天途徑；
23787,堅持十架神的榮耀終滿我心，
23788,在此我要歡呼我已跑完全程。
23789,"I, pilgrim of the night; His star so faintly steers."
23790,"Although the darkness has enveloped me,"
23791,Its glimmer still appears!
23792,"Thro' piercing thorns I walk in agony,"
23793,My God I must draw near.
23794,"My song at midnight gloom shall rise to Thee,"
23795,"In silence I endure, In silence I endure."
23796,"I, pilgrim of the night; His voice my soul revives."
23797,"Though snares around me cause my heart to fear,"
23798,His hand does surely guide.
23799,"Though tests along my way cause hopeless drear,"
23800,His voice my heart consoles.
23801,"With healing in His wings my Lord appears,"
23802,"Embracing me in love, Embracing me in love."
23803,"I, pilgrim of the night; The twilight's flick'ring on."
23804,"Though weeping, still my soul bursts with delight-"
23805,His radiance I behold!
23806,With tear-stained face I glance back thro' the night;
23807,"My journey nears its close,"
23808,"Descending is the glory, O, so bright!"
23809,To Him I swiftly run! To Him I swiftly run!
23810,我是黑夜行人，星光朦朧前引；
23811,雖然黑夜四圍緊壓我身，
23812,難掩星光輝映。
23813,荊刺我足使我傷痛難忍，
23814,迫我緊靠我神；
23815,有時深夜歌唱，聲聞天庭，
23816,經常堅忍無聲，經常堅忍無聲。
23817,我是黑夜行人，祂聲甦我疲魂；
23818,野地陷阱密佈，使我心驚，
23819,幸祂能手引領。
23820,一路遭遇使我膽怯意冷，
23821,得祂慈聲慰問；
23822,祂手光線射出醫治大能，
23823,祂手繞我胸頸，祂手繞我胸頸。
23824,我是黑夜行人，晨光逐漸露影；
23825,我眼流淚，我魂爆發歡聲，
23826,遙見恩主慈容。
23827,回顧來程，臉上猶留淚痕，
23828,一切已近尾聲；
23829,前面榮耀正在急速降臨，
23830,我要向主急奔，我要向主急奔。
23831,"I choose Thee, blessed will of God! In Thee alone my heart can rest."
23832,"The current of Thy love, I know, Can only bear me to Thy breast."
23833,我願揀選神祢美旨，惟你能使我心安息。
23834,祢愛的洪濤，我認識，必領我進入祢胸臆。
23835,我願揀選神祢美旨，惟祢能使我心安息。
23901,“Wrecked outright on Jesus' breast:”
23902,Only “wrecked” souls thus can sing;
23903,"Little boats that hug the shore,"
23904,"Fearing what the storm may bring,"
23905,"Never find on Jesus' breast,"
23906,All that “wrecked” souls mean by rest.
23907,“Wrecked outright!” So we lament;
23908,"But when storms have done their worst,"
23909,"Then the soul, surviving all,"
23910,In Eternal arms is nursed;
23911,There to find that nought can move
23912,"One, embosomed in such love."
23913,“Wrecked outright!” No more to own
23914,E'en a craft to sail the sea;
23915,"Still a voyager, yet now"
23916,Anchored to Infinity;
23917,Nothing left to do but fling
23918,"Care aside, and simply cling."
23919,"“Wrecked outright!” 'Twas purest gain,"
23920,Henceforth other craft can see
23921,"That the storm may be a boon,"
23922,"That, however rough the sea,"
23923,"God Himself doth watchful stand,"
23924,For the “wreck” is in His hand.
23925,“破毀帶我到主懷！”
23926,毀後如此唱出來！
23927,小船若是緊靠岸，
23928,深怕風浪的為患，
23929,難知在主的懷裏，
23930,毀後所享的安息。
23931,我們哀歎：“被破毀！”
23932,豈知“破毀”當讚美！
23933,風浪無情的損傷，
23934,使我主懷享餵養。
23935,在此安息主懷中，
23936,何能再將我搖動？
23937,“破毀”之後，不需要
23938,任何航行的技巧；
23939,雖然仍舊在航行，
23940,卻是拋錨在天庭；
23941,再不需要作或慮，
23942,只要我和主同居。
23943,“破毀！”成為我純益，
23944,其他航者要驚奇；
23945,像似殘忍的摧毀，
23946,實是化裝的恩惠！
23947,毀後乃是在主手，
23948,有主自己來看守。
23949,"Cross of Christ! Lead onward, Thro' the Holy War:"
23950,"In this sign we conquer, Now and ever more."
23951,"Not of man the power, Not to man the fame;"
23952,We are victors only In our leader's name.
23953,"Cross of Christ! Lead onward, Thro' the Holy War;"
23954,"Not with pomp and pageant, Not in earthly pride;"
23955,We must fight our battles Like the Crucified.
23956,"Overcome by suff'ring, Conquer thro' defeat;"
23957,Tried and tested daily In the furnace heat.
23958,"Panoplied in graces, Bold, yet humbly meek;"
23959,"Resting while we're working, Strong, but ever weak."
23960,"Timid, tho' courageous, Gaining as we give;"
23961,"Crucified with Jesus, Yet in Him, we live."
23962,"Marching in the pathway That the Master trod,"
23963,Walks One daily with us Like the Son of God.
23964,"To the end enduring, Armour ne'er laid down"
23965,Till the Cross leads upward To the blood-bought crown.
23966,惟有常出代價，願背十字架，
23967,我們纔會得勝，纔會得權能。
23968,不是自己力量，不是人思想，
23969,乃是耶穌尊名，使我們得勝。
23970,應當除去誇耀，絕一切機巧；
23971,我們應當爭戰，像耶穌一般：
23972,藉死亡得權能，藉失敗得勝；
23973,因十字架苦難，毀壞了撒但。
23974,既勇敢，又溫柔，慈仁且奮鬥；
23975,雖工作，亦安息，剛強卻無力。
23976,欲得反倒賜給，有能卻無依；
23977,雖與救主同釘，卻滿有生命。
23978,我們若隨救主，走祂的道路，
23979,必須背十字架，與祂纔融洽。
23980,應當忍耐到底，雖死亦不避，
23981,直等我們上天，得血染冠冕。
24006,"Life out of death — dear Master, is it spoken"
24007,"Of the life here, or in the better land?"
24008,"Nay, wherefore wait? The vessel marred and broken"
24009,Shall now be moulded by the Potter's hand.
24010,"Life out of death — oh, wondrous resurrection!"
24011,"Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power."
24012,"Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction,"
24013,"“Not I, but Christ” in me — from hour to hour."
24014,"Life out of death — a pilgrim path and lonely,"
24015,Trodden by those who glory in the Cross;
24016,"They live in fellowship with Jesus only,"
24017,And for His sake count earthly gain but loss.
24018,Life out of death — blest mission to be ever
24019,"Bearing the living water, brimming o'er,"
24020,"With life abundant from the clear, pure river,"
24021,Telling that thirsty souls need thirst no more.
24022,由死而生–恩主，這乃是說明
24023,生命在此，或是在於來世？
24024,不必等候！毀壞破碎的器皿，
24025,即今可在陶人手中陶製。
24026,由死而生–何等奇妙的復活，
24027,種時明感軟弱，起時強壯！
24028,祢的生命顯於勞碌和折磨，
24029,時刻非我，乃是基督我王。
24030,由死而生–客旅道路何孤單，
24031,認識十架者卻都願同行；
24032,效法祂死，他們與祂同苦難，
24033,因祂，就將萬事當作有損。
24034,由死而生–福哉，使命能長遠！
24035,從天上的清澈純淨江河，
24036,生命豐盛，帶著洋溢的活泉，
24037,告訴渴人，從茲無需再渴。
24038,“Have you grown weary of the cross?” Tenderly asked the Lord.
24039,Have you regretted choosing Him to be your all in all?
24040,Have you intended to withdraw The loyal pledge you've made?
24041,"My dearest Lord, tho' deep the pain, Yet deeper is Thy love."
24042,No suff'ring blow or painful tears can move my love for Thee.
24043,"Tho' dark the night and rough the way, My soul does groan and sigh,"
24044,"Still by Thy grace I will softly sing, “I'll keep walking by Thy side.”"
24045,"“Reflect upon my path on earth.” This doing, lifts my heart,"
24046,"For seeking me a wand'ring soul, He deigned to come to earth."
24047,"Throughout His way was ruggedness, Loneliness e'er untold"
24048,"His life, so oft not understood E'en by His faithful band."
24049,"His heart, did feel such solitude, While thousands thronged His side."
24050,"His love, so selfless yet so great, Does move my tears to flow."
24051,Amazing grace! Such wondrous love Prompts me His way to go.
24052,No more can pow'r of barrenness Encase me to destroy.
24053,"The joy and light Thou givest me, Awake my weary soul,"
24054,"Bring me into sweet fellowship, Constrain my will to yield."
24055,"For that, while others sweetly sleep Let me Thy vigil keep;"
24056,"For that, while others gayly laugh, Let me before Thee weep."
24057,"For that, while others quietly rest, Let me in labor reap."
24058,O that I may with the Lord return Bringing in sheaves one day.
24059,"I'd die to all this world can give, For He is calling me;"
24060,"I'd rather all my freedom lose, That others be revived;"
24061,"I'd die to self throughout my days, Bringing the wand'rers home."
24062,"What wondrous grace! While losing all, O how my gains abound!"
24063,"Forfeiting all to follow on, I find all in my hands."
24064,This path of loss has won for me A life of endless joy.
24065,"Then to my glorious home I'll fly, At the ending of my time."
24066,“十架曾否使你疲倦？”恩主柔聲詢問。
24067,你心曾否懊悔揀選祂來作你的分？
24068,你心曾否意欲收回立志遵祂命令？
24069,親愛的主受苦雖多，愛卻是何等深；
24070,沒有一種痛苦打擊，能稍移愛你心。
24071,雖然道路崎嶇難行，使我發出呻吟；
24072,靠恩我仍柔聲歌唱：我要與你同行！
24073,“你要思想我的道路，”思想就會興奮；
24074,祂為尋我流落迷人，竟來此地微行。
24075,祂受鼓舞何等的少，四圍都是虛偽；
24076,祂受誤會攻擊，竟在親近祂的圈內；
24077,祂心感覺何等孤單，雖有萬人在圍。
24078,愛何無私！祂的行徑，感動我心欲淚；
24079,恩何希奇！此愛今正催我效祂行為。
24080,再無任何荒涼力量，能來掩蔽摧毀；
24081,因祢所賜喜樂光亮，使我疲魂甦醒，
24082,導我進入甘甜交通，迫我服祢命令。
24083,為此正當他人安眠，讓我深夜不睡；
24084,為此正當他人歡笑，讓我座前流淚；
24085,為此正當他人安息，讓我收割疲憊；
24086,好使我能與主同帶豐滿禾捆而歸。
24087,我以死向世上一切，因主正在招呼；
24088,我寧捨棄一切自由，好使多人得甦；
24089,願意以死向我自己，來領浪子歸回。
24090,恩何希奇喪失一切，所得何其豐多；
24091,撇下所有，全心跟隨，反覺萬有在握。
24092,失喪生命，為我換來無窮喜樂生活；
24093,直等今生時日過盡，進入諸天居所。
24094,"Must Jesus bear the cross alone, and all the world go free?"
24095,"No, there's a cross for everyone, And there's a cross for me."
24096,"How happy are the saints above, Who once went sorr'wing here;"
24097,"But now they taste unmingled love, And joy without a tear."
24098,"The consecrated cross I'll bear, Till death shall set me free,"
24099,"And then go home my crown to wear, For there's a crown for me."
24100,"Upon the crystal pavement, down At Jesus' pierced feet,"
24101,"Joyful, I'll cast my golden crown, And His dear name repeat."
24102,耶穌豈當獨背十架，世人卻可逃脫？
24103,不，不，每人皆有十架，也有一架為我。
24104,我要背負捨己之架，未死，不求豁免，
24105,有日當我歸回天家，頭戴榮耀冠冕。
24106,當我俯伏耶穌腳前，在那光明天庭；
24107,我要歡然投下冠冕，反覆稱頌主名。
24108,寶貴十架，榮耀冠冕！榮耀復活之晨！
24109,天使自天來我身邊，接我往上飛奔。
24110,"I have decided to follow Jesus,"
24111,"No turning back, no turning back."
24112,"Tho' none go with me, I still will follow,"
24113,"The cross before me, the world behind me;"
24114,"My cross I'll carry till I see Jesus,"
24115,"No turning back, I'll follow Him."
24116,我已經決定要跟隨耶穌，
24117,永不回頭，永不回頭。
24118,雖無人同行，我仍要跟隨，
24119,十架在前面，世界在背後，
24120,我要背十架，直到見主面，
24121,"Once a sinner far from Jesus,"
24122,"I was perishing with cold,"
24123,But the blessed Saviour heard me when I cried;
24124,"Then He threw His robe around me,"
24125,"And He led me to His fold,"
24126,And I'm living on the hallelujah side.
24127,"Oh, glory be to Jesus,"
24128,Let the hallelujahs roll;
24129,"Help me ring the Saviour's praises far and wide,"
24130,For I've opened up tow'rd heaven
24131,"All the windows of my soul,"
24132,Tho' the world may sweep around me
24133,"With her dazzle and her dreams,"
24134,"Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,"
24135,For my soul looks up to heaven
24136,"Where the golden sunlight gleams,"
24137,Not for all earth's golden millions
24138,"Would I leave this precious place,"
24139,"Tho' the tempter to persuade me oft has tried,"
24140,"For I'm safe in God's pavilion,"
24141,"Happy in His love and grace,"
24142,"Here the sun is always shining,"
24143,Here the sky is always bright;
24144,"'Tis no place for gloomy Christians to abide,"
24145,For my soul is filled with music
24146,"And my heart with great delight,"
24147,And upon the streets of glory
24148,"When we reach the other shore,"
24149,"And have safely crossed the Jordan's rolling tide,"
24150,"You will find me shouting ""Glory!"""
24151,"Just outside my mansion door,"
24152,Where I'm living on the hallelujah side.
24153,曾是罪人遠離耶穌﹐
24154,正陷悲慘滅亡中﹐
24155,當我呼求親愛救主即垂聽﹔
24156,賜下義袍遮蔽我身﹐
24157,並領我歸祂羊圈﹐
24158,我是活在哈利路亞這一邊。
24159,啊！榮耀都歸耶穌﹐
24160,願哈利路亞聲揚！
24161,助我頻讚救主聲高遠又廣！
24162,因我心靈之窗
24163,皆已大開放朝向天堂﹐
24164,世界美夢炫耀閃爍﹐
24165,極其技巧誘我心﹐
24166,我心不羨這屬世虛空驕傲﹔
24167,因我心正注目天上﹐
24168,主如陽光何輝煌﹐
24169,我今所居寶貴境地﹐
24170,億萬黃金也不換﹐
24171,縱然誘者經常欺騙和試探﹔
24172,住祂居所因祂恩典﹐
24173,慈愛穩妥樂常滿﹐
24174,在此陽光永遠普照﹐
24175,在此天色常蔚藍﹐
24176,灰暗聖徒在此無處可容身！
24177,因我魂中喜樂常滿﹐
24178,我心常感神喜悅﹐
24179,逍遙行走黃金街上﹐
24180,當我至終抵彼岸﹐
24181,約但怒濤洶湧之中安渡過！
24182,我將歡呼“何等榮耀！”
24183,我已安抵我家鄉﹐
24202,"Make me a captive, Lord,"
24203,And then I shall be free;
24204,"Force me to render up my sword,"
24205,And I shall conq'ror be.
24206,I sink in life's alarms
24207,"When by myself I stand,"
24208,"Imprison me within Thine arms,"
24209,And strong shall be my hand.
24210,My heart is weak and poor
24211,Until it master find;
24212,"It has no spring of action sure,"
24213,It varies with the wind;
24214,It cannot freely move
24215,Till Thou hast wrought its chain;
24216,"Enslave it with Thy matchless love,"
24217,And deathless it shall reign.
24218,My power is faint and low
24219,Till I have learned to serve;
24220,"It wants the needed fire to glow,"
24221,It wants the breeze to nerve;
24222,It cannot drive the world
24223,Until itself be driven;
24224,Its flag can only be unfurled
24225,When Thou shalt breathe from heaven.
24226,My will is not my own
24227,Till Thou hast made it Thine;
24228,If it would reach the monarch's throne
24229,It must its crown resign;
24230,It only stands unbent
24231,"Amid the clashing strife,"
24232,"When on Thy bosom it has leant,"
24233,And found in Thee its life.
24234,求主把我捆綁，
24235,我纔得著釋放；
24236,願主迫我向主繳械，
24237,我纔得勝奏捷。
24238,當我倚靠自己，
24239,我就失敗危亟；
24240,當主膀臂將我監禁，
24241,我手就更奮興。
24242,我心未交主時，
24243,真是軟弱愚癡；
24244,自己所願自己不行，
24245,萬事漂流無定。
24246,主若未加鎖鍊，
24247,就難自由進前；
24248,求主慈愛將它奴隸，
24249,它纔會得能力。
24250,我的生命未死，
24251,終身總是喪失；
24252,勝少敗多，實無能力，
24253,時為肉體嘆息。
24254,我若沒有死過，
24255,我就難以活著；
24256,求主使我脫離自己，
24257,纔會完全得祢。
24258,我今認識了祢，
24259,也略知道自己，
24260,所以今後真不願意，
24261,再藉天然能力。
24262,求主永遠的靈，
24263,使我生命全釘；
24264,使我治死肉體行為，
24265,主興盛，我衰微。
24304,"“Give Me thy heart,” says the Father above,"
24305,No gift so precious to Him as our love;
24306,"Softly He whispers, wherever thou art,"
24307,"“Gratefully trust Me, and give Me thy heart.”"
24308,"“Give Me thy heart, give Me thy heart,”"
24309,"Hear the soft whisper, wherever thou art:"
24310,From this dark world He would draw thee apart;
24311,"Speaking so tenderly, “Give Me thy heart.”"
24312,"“Give Me thy heart,” says the Saviour of men,"
24313,Calling in mercy again and again;
24314,"“Turn now from sin, and from evil depart,"
24315,Have I not died for thee? give Me thy heart.”
24316,"“Give Me thy heart,” says the Spirit divine,"
24317,"“All that thou hast, to My keeping resign;"
24318,"Grace more abounding is Mine to impart,"
24319,Make full surrender and give Me thy heart.”
24320,“將心給我!”天父呼召聲音，
24321,這是獻給祂最珍貴禮物;
24322,隨時隨地祂對你細聲說:
24323,”甘心交託我，並將心給我。”
24324,“將心給我，將心給我！”
24325,聽見嗎?這隨時隨地呼召;
24326,祂要救你，脫離俗世漩渦，
24327,慈聲向你呼召，“將心給我!”
24328,“將心給我!”救主呼召聲音，
24329,憐愛的呼聲一次又一次，
24330,”轉回迷途，遠離惡者罪過，
24331,我已為你死，請將心給我。”
24332,“將心給我!”聖靈呼召聲音，
24333,”願你將一切，聽從我指導，
24334,你必享受主恩，多而又多;
24335,完全順服吧!並將心給我。”
24336,"You have longed for sweet peace, and for faith to increase,"
24337,"And have earnestly, fervently prayed;"
24338,"But you cannot have rest, or be perfectly blest,"
24339,Until all on the altar is laid.
24340,Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
24341,"Your heart, Does the Spirit control?"
24342,"You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,"
24343,As you yield Him your body and soul.
24344,"Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,"
24345,"And have peace and contentment alway,"
24346,You must do His sweet will to be free from all ill;
24347,On the altar you all you must lay.
24348,"Oh, we never can know what the Lord will bestow,"
24349,"Of the blessings for which we have prayed,"
24350,"Till our body and soul He doth folly control,"
24351,And our all on the altar is laid.
24352,Who can tell all the love He will send from above!
24353,"Oh, how happy our heart will be made!"
24354,"Oh what fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet,"
24355,When our all on the altar is laid!
24356,是否渴望充滿信心，平安，甘甜?
24357,是否曾掙扎禱告不息?
24358,但安息何難得!但祝福何難尋!
24359,除非將一切獻於祭壇。
24360,是否你一切已完全獻於祭壇，
24361,是否你心已歸聖靈掌管?
24362,你必能得平安，充滿安息，甘甜，
24363,正當將一切獻於祭壇。
24364,是否與主同行，在祂話語光中，
24365,一路常因平安而心歡;
24366,你必要遵主旨，遠離一切惡行，
24367,務要將一切獻於祭壇。
24368,但我永不能知愛何奇妙深厚，
24369,雖曾不斷禱告並尋求;
24370,直等到我心靈全歸恩主掌管，
24371,並將一切都獻於祭壇。
24372,我口何能述說祂愛從天傾注，
24373,我心洋溢何等大喜樂;
24374,如何交通親密，滿足在主腳前，
24375,正當一切都獻於祭壇!
24397,"O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found, And found in Thee alone,"
24398,"The peace, the joy I sought so long, The bliss till now unknown."
24399,"Now none but Christ can satisfy, None other name for me;"
24400,"There's love and life and lasting joy, Lord Jesus, found in Thee."
24401,"I sighed for rest and happiness, I yearned for them, not Thee;"
24402,"But while I passed my Saviour by, His love laid hold on me."
24403,"I tried the broken cisterns, Lord, But, ah, the waters failed!"
24404,"E'en as I stooped to drink they fled, And mocked me as I wailed."
24405,"The pleasures lost I sadly mourned, But never wept for Thee,"
24406,"Till grace the sightless eyes received, Thy loveliness to see."
24407,以前我心苦楚悲傷，永生之福無望；
24408,惟有基督今為我王，我心充滿歡暢。
24409,今主耶穌滿足我心，並無別人如祂；
24410,歷久愛情、生命、歡欣，都由耶穌賜下。
24411,以前我心思慕祝福，並不來尋基督；
24412,我雖忽略我的救主，祂愛卻來尋吾。
24413,我曾試過破裂水池，希望痛快而喝；
24414,哎喲，水卻完全漏失，譏諷我的乾渴。
24415,祝福喪失，我心悲哀，仍未想到祂來；
24416,蒙昧心目，祂為我開，始知祂是可愛。
24479,"My heart is resting, O my God, I will give thanks and sing;"
24480,My heart is at the secret source of ev'ry precious thing.
24481,"Oh, peace of God that passeth thought, I daily, hourly sing;"
24482,Now this frail vessel thou hast made no hand but Thine shall fill;
24483,"The waters of the earth have failed, and I am thirsty still."
24484,"I thirst for springs of heav'nly life, and here all day they rise;"
24485,"I seek the treasure of Thy love, and close at hand it lies."
24486,"A glad, new song is in my mouth, to long loved music set,"
24487,A song of praise for all the grace I have not tasted yet.
24488,I have a heritage of joy that yet I must not see;
24489,The hand that bled to make it mine is keeping it for me.
24490,我神﹐我心充滿安寧﹐我要稱謝歌頌﹗
24491,我心今居祕密泉源﹐深嘗寶貴事物。
24492,出人意外神聖平安﹐是我時刻歌頌﹔
24493,這個微弱受造器皿﹐惟有祢能充滿﹔
24494,飲遍一切世上佳泉﹐我仍乾渴不休。
24495,我所渴慕生命泉源﹐如今終日湧流﹔
24496,祢愛所藏一切珍寶﹐隨手即可取用。
24497,喜樂新歌今在我口﹐我所久愛曲調﹔
24498,此歌讚美無窮恩典﹐至今尚未盡嘗。
24499,我的產業令我喜樂﹐雖我猶未盡歷﹔
24500,流血的手為我持守﹐使它完全屬我。
24501,To Jesus ev'ry day I find my heart is closer drawn;
24502,He's fairer than the glory of the gold and purple dawn;
24503,"He's all my fancy pictures in its fairest dreams, and more;"
24504,Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.
24505,The half cannot be fancied this side the golden shore;
24506,"Oh, there He'll be still sweeter than He ever was before."
24507,His glory broke upon me when I saw Him from afar;
24508,"He's fairer than the lily, brighter than the morning star;"
24509,He fills and satisfies my longing spirit o'er and o'er.
24510,"My heart is sometimes heavy, but He comes with sweet relief;"
24511,He folds me to His bosom when I droop with blighting grief;
24512,I love the Christ who all my burdens in His body bore;
24513,我心感覺與主耶穌每日更加親近﹐
24514,祂比黎明燦爛金色榮光更加明艷﹔
24515,祂就是我所追求的一切幻想美夢﹐
24516,祂一天比一天更加美麗、芬芳、甘甜。
24517,一半也猜想不到﹐金色海岸那邊﹔
24518,那日我主比以前更加美麗﹐更甘甜。
24519,當我遠遠見主祂的榮光向我照耀﹐
24520,祂比晨星更明亮﹐比百合花更鮮艷﹔
24521,祂使我渴慕的心靈得著滋潤滿足﹐
24522,我心雖有時沉重﹐祂卻帶來甘甜愛﹐
24523,當我挫敗而喪氣﹐祂卻擁我入祂懷﹔
24524,祂如此擔我重負﹐我心怎不將祂戀﹐
24525,"How excellent, O Lord, is Thy Name in all the earth!"
24526,Who hast set Thy glory above the heavens:
24527,"The works of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars."
24528,主啊﹐祢的名在全地何其美﹗
24529,祢將祢榮耀彰顯於天﹕
24530,祢指頭造的天﹐並月亮、星宿。
24531,"Fainting in the desert, Israel's thousands stand"
24532,"At the rock of Kadesh, Hark! the Lord's command,"
24533,"Speak to the Rock, bid the waters flow;"
24534,"Strike not its bosom, opened long ago,"
24535,"Speak to the Rock, 'till the waters flow."
24536,"Speak to the Rock, bid the waters flow,"
24537,"Doubt not the Spirit, given long ago;"
24538,Take what He waiteth freely to bestow.
24539,Drink 'till its fullness all thy being know.
24540,"Blessed Rock of Ages, Thou art open still,"
24541,"Blessed Holy Spirit, all our being fills;"
24542,"Still Thou dost say, wherefore struggle so?"
24543,"Call to the Spirit, whisper soft and low."
24544,"Speak to the Rock, bid the waters flow."
24545,"Oh, for trust more simple, fully to believe,"
24546,"Oh, for hearts more childlike, freely to receive;"
24547,"E'en as a babe, on its mother's breast,"
24548,"So on Thy bosom let my spirit rest,"
24549,"Filled with Thy life, with Thy blessing blest."
24550,在曠野加低斯，有神的選民，
24551,因乾渴快要死；忽聽見聲音：
24552,“吩咐磐石，發出活水來！”
24553,不是要擊打，不是要等待；
24554,只要吩咐，活水就流開。
24555,神的聖靈已住你心間，
24556,為何到如今不見活水流？
24557,一切的豐盛，等候你發現，
24558,你用信相信，就甚麼都有。
24559,主耶穌的聖名，是信心根據，
24560,神永遠的聖靈，已住你深處；
24561,祂今發問：掙扎果為何？
24562,聯合是事實，為何仍乾渴？
24563,約但河上，仍舊有聖鴿。
24564,但願心意簡單，完全的相信！
24565,但願心思平安，不再苦苦尋！
24566,如同嬰孩，靜臥主懷間，
24567,向世界斷奶，認識主愛甜，
24568,享祂豐富，順服祂差遣。
24569,從前我亦曾熱心，多努力，求上進，
24570,可憐現在已改變，不與救主親近；
24571,追想昔日殷勤景，深夜寐，清晨興，
24572,如何辛苦不自顧，而今卻冷如冰！
24573,我豈能忘救主？我豈可離天父？
24574,祂心為我憂傷，我心安忍不顧？
24575,從前我已獻全身，雖勞碌，不為金，
24576,而今卻為世俗奔，卻與世俗相親；
24577,從前持守今改變，是放縱，說消遣，
24578,多年流浪不懊悔，何日纔會生厭？
24579,從前我心專愛主，在祂外，無所慕，
24580,時常想念熱如火，無論夢寐醒甦；
24581,世俗人情皆無意，自己事都丟棄，
24582,今則追求全屬己，與俗復有何異？
24583,追想昔日跪主前，雖在地如在天，
24584,應許祢說“從今起，我只聽祢差遣，
24585,願意順服失自由，在祢外，無他求;”
24586,至今為時並不久，此心已歸烏有！
24587,主外勞碌總是空，如捉影，如捕風，
24588,多年流落羊群外，無祢怎能亨通；
24589,世界情慾快過去，豈可再受駕御？
24590,愛主多年在等候，豈可依然猶豫？
24591,晨星將現夜已闌，生愈過，時愈暫，
24592,立即脫離墮落處，重來求祢喜歡；
24593,拒絕世俗和魔鬼，再來嘗天滋味，
24594,愛心已失今再得，仍站從前地位。
24595,有人已離主別行他途，
24596,有人已溜出羊群保護，
24597,有人已動心貪愛世俗，
24598,主，是我否？主，是我否？
24599,主，是我否？此言猶如利刃刺入我心，
24600,刺入何等的深；若有一人要失去主的分，
24601,有人竟把主撇在背後，
24602,有人竟隨從惡人計謀，
24603,有人竟作到聖靈擔憂，
24604,有人竟甘心辜負主恩，
24605,有人竟甘心事奉瑪門，
24606,有人竟甘心罪中下沉，
24607,有人已否認救主耶穌，
24608,有人已使祂蒙受羞辱，
24609,有人已背叛，賣友、賣主，
24610,有人將被提到主面前，
24611,有人將享受安息甘甜，
24612,有人將得著生命冠冕，
24613,救主祢的如火眼睛搜尋發光探照我心；
24614,使我看見前所未見，使我仆倒在祢座前！
24615,哦，主，祢用如火聖目，注視我的最深之處；
24616,充滿莊嚴，充滿生命，充滿赦免，充滿權能。
24617,祢用如刃銳利眼神，使我痛悔，使我甦醒；
24618,直到祢靈滿我全人，到處泛濫，榮耀無盡。
24619,救主，祢的如火眼睛，照亮我的如夜生命；
24620,使我最深最隱部分，完全赤露，完全顯明。
24621,救主，求用如火眼睛，投入我魂每一部分；
24622,有如利刃刺入剖開，我愛與慾，我靈與魂。
24623,救主，用祢如火眼睛，細細鑒察我心我行；
24624,直到處處聖火直焚，每一角落都被更新。
24625,從前我是風聞有祢，今日我是親眼見祢；
24626,祢的眼目使我傾圯，祢的膀臂助我站立。
24627,Jesus has loved me — wonderful Saviour!
24628,"Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why;"
24629,He came to rescue sinners unworthy;
24630,"My heart He conquered, for Him I would die."
24631,"Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour!"
24632,"Glory to Jesus, the One I adore;"
24633,"Glory to Jesus, and praise evermore."
24634,Jesus has saved me — wonderful Saviour!
24635,"Jesus has saved me, I cannot tell how;"
24636,"But this I do know, He came, my ransom,"
24637,Dying on Calv'ry with thorns on His brow.
24638,Jesus will lead me — wonderful Saviour!
24639,"Jesus will lead me, I cannot tell where;"
24640,"So I will follow thro' joy or sorrow,"
24641,"Sunshine or tempest, since He leads me there."
24642,耶穌已愛我﹐奇妙的救主﹗
24643,耶穌已愛我—為何﹖我難述﹔
24644,祂親來拯救這不配罪人﹐
24645,我心已臣服﹐甘為祂捨身。
24646,榮耀歸耶穌﹐奇妙的救主﹗
24647,榮耀歸耶穌﹐我心所愛慕。
24648,榮耀歸耶穌﹐永稱頌歡呼。
24649,耶穌已救我﹐奇妙的救主﹗
24650,耶穌已救我—如何﹖我難述﹔
24651,我知祂親來為我付贖價﹐
24652,頭戴荊棘冕﹐捨命在十架。
24653,耶穌必領我﹐奇妙的救主﹗
24654,耶穌必領我—何往﹖我難述﹔
24655,但我必跟隨﹐不論境如何﹐
24656,陰暗或晴明﹐憂苦或福樂。
24657,"When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,"
24658,"When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,"
24659,"Count your many blessings, name them one by one,"
24660,And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.
24661,"Count your blessings, name them one by one,"
24662,Count your blessings see what God hath done;
24663,"Are you ever burdened with a load of care,"
24664,Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
24665,"Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,"
24666,And you will be singing as the days go by.
24667,"When you look at others with their lands and gold,"
24668,"Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold,"
24669,"Count your many blessings money cannot buy,"
24670,"Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high."
24671,"So amid the conflict whether great or small,"
24672,"Do not be discouraged, God is over all;"
24673,"Count your many blessings, angels will attend,"
24674,Help and comfort give you to your journey's end.
24675,當你經過試煉，茫然無所從，
24676,你心絕望，以為甚麼都失蹤；
24677,就當數主恩惠，當一一的數，
24678,你就要希奇祂曾如何眷顧。
24679,數主恩惠！要一一的數！
24680,記看祂曾如何眷顧你！
24681,你就要希奇祂曾如何愛你。
24682,當你有所掛慮，如同挑重擔，
24683,覺得所要負的十架苦難堪；
24684,你若數主恩惠，疑惑要消散，
24685,並要不止住的歡樂和頌讚。
24686,當你看見別人屬世的亨通，
24687,你若念主應許，心就不會動；
24688,你所受的恩惠，原來無處買，
24689,你有了父的家，又有主的愛。
24690,所以，無論遇見大小的試探，
24691,不必灰心，萬事總有主承擔；
24692,你若數主恩惠，天使要來臨，
24693,伺候你，服侍你，並使你歡欣。
24694,"Wonderful grace of Jesus, greater than all my sin;"
24695,"How shall my tongue describe it, where shall its praise begin?"
24696,"Taking away my burden, setting my spirit free;"
24697,For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.
24698,"Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,"
24699,Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;
24700,"Higher than the mountain, sparkling like a fountain,"
24701,"All sufficient grace for even me,"
24702,"Broader than the scope of my transgressions,"
24703,Greater far than all my sin and shame.
24704,"O magnify the precious name of Jesus, Praise His name!"
24705,"Wonderful grace of Jesus, reaching to all the lost,"
24706,"By it I have been pardoned, saved to the uttermost,"
24707,"Chains have been torn asunder, giving me liberty;"
24708,耶穌奇妙的救恩﹐超過我眾過犯﹔
24709,我口舌怎能述說﹐更將從何頌讚﹖
24710,祂除我罪擔憂愁﹐使我得著自由﹔

24712,主耶穌奇妙無比的救恩﹐
24713,深過波濤滾滾大海洋﹔
24714,高過最高山嶺﹐美過最美泉源﹐
24715,奇妙救恩足夠我需用﹔
24716,闊過我一生所行的過犯﹐
24717,大過我一切罪污邪情﹐
24718,我要稱揚主聖名﹐我要讚美主聖名﹗
24719,耶穌奇妙的救恩﹐臨到失喪之人﹔
24720,藉救恩我罪得赦﹐並拯救我靈魂。
24721,主為我解脫捆綁﹐使我得著釋放﹔
24722,"All to Jesus I surrender, All to Him I freely give;"
24723,"I will ever love and trust Him, In His presence daily live."
24724,"I surrender all, I surrender all."
24725,"All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all."

24732,All to Jesus I surrender: Now I feel the sacred flame;
24733,"Oh, the joy of full salvation! Glory, glory to His Name!"
24734,盡我所有歸給耶穌，甘心樂意全奉獻；
24735,我今一生熱愛救主，天天活在祂面前。
24736,全所有奉獻，全所有奉獻，
24737,永遠歸給慈愛救主，全所有奉獻。
24738,盡我所有歸給耶穌，在祂腳前我俯伏；
24739,罪中之樂棄如糞土，有主收留，我滿足。
24740,盡我所有歸給耶穌，我今對你全歸依；
24741,聖靈見證何等堅固，你是屬我，我屬你。
24742,盡我所有歸給耶穌，我今仰望等候你；
24743,你的愛心、能力、祝福，求你向我多賜給。
24744,盡我所有歸給耶穌，聖火將我燒乾淨，
24745,完全救恩何等豐富，榮耀、榮耀歸主名。
24746,我已揀選主耶穌，揀選祂作世界；
24747,祂愛實在是充足，滿足我的一切。
24748,主，我是你的器皿，只有你能充盈；
24749,敘加的水飲千井，渴仍不停。
24750,耶穌，耶穌，我揀選主耶穌！
24751,我心今正住在所有甘甜事物之源；
24752,耶穌，耶穌，祂乃是我滿足！
24753,是祂消除我的要求，平靜我的意願。
24754,我已揀選主耶穌，揀選祂作喜樂；
24755,有祂，我心雖痛苦，依然會唱詩歌；
24756,有祂，我無別原因，也發喜樂聲音；
24757,因我所有的歡欣，是在祂心。
24758,我已揀選主耶穌，揀選祂作希望；
24759,祂賜基業甚豐富，使我不住思量。
24760,將它賜我的救主，乃是我的至寶；
24761,今天我心有催促：得祂最好。
24762,我已揀選主耶穌，揀選祂作我主；
24763,祂愛實在是難述，嘗到就會屈服。
24764,我已奉獻我一切，向祂我無要求；
24765,我心只求祂喜悅，怕祂心憂。
24766,北風阿，求速興起！南風阿，快吹來！
24767,吹在我心的園地，滿園芬芳播開。
24768,願我的所愛到這裏來，
24769,與我永同在，嘗我純潔愛；
24770,與我永同在，嘗我純潔愛。
24771,哪噠香膏澆祂頭，秀麗髮擦祂腳；
24772,正當王坐席時候，滿屋馨香四飄。
24773,祂像林中蘋果樹，我喜歡祂柔蔭；
24774,果實甘甜又成熟，增我力，暢我心。
24775,我心所愛者，來阿，–我屬你，你屬我–
24776,我們同往田間吧，享受各樣佳果。
24777,願我在祂的心上，銘刻如同印戳；
24778,祂愛比死更堅強，眾水不能淹沒。
24779,除你以外，在高天我還可以有誰？
24780,除你以外，在人間我也別無所歸。
24781,神，祢正在重排我的前途，
24782,祢也正在拆毀我的建築；
24783,忠心事奉的人日少一日，
24784,誤會增加，清白逐漸消失。
24785,我眼有淚珠，看不清祢臉面，
24786,好像祢話語真實不如前；
24787,祢使我減少，好叫祢更加添，
24788,好叫祢旨意比前更甘甜。
24789,我幾手要求祢停止祢手，
24790,當我覺得我已無力再受；
24791,但祢是神，祢怎可以讓步？
24792,求祢不要讓步，等我順服。
24793,如果祢的旨意和祢喜樂
24794,乃是在乎我負痛苦之軛，
24795,就願我的喜樂乃是在乎
24796,順服祢的旨意來受痛苦。
24797,好像祢的喜樂所需代價
24798,乃是需我受祢阻扼倒下；
24799,所以我就歡迎祢的阻扼，
24800,好叫我能使祢的心喜樂。
24801,祢將車輛賜與別人乘坐，
24802,祢使他們從我頭上軋過；
24803,我的所有祢正下手剝奪，
24804,求祢留下剝奪的手給我。
24805,"Are you weary, are you heavy hearted?"
24806,"Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus;"
24807,Are you grieving over joys departed?
24808,Tell it to Jesus alone.
24809,"Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus,"
24810,He is a friend that's well known;
24811,"You have no other such a friend or brother,"
24812,Do the tears flow down your cheeks unbidden?
24813,"Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,"
24814,Have you sins that to men's eyes are hidden?
24815,Do you fear the gath'ring clouds of sorrow?
24816,Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow?
24817,Are you troubled at the thought of dying?
24818,For Christ's coming Kingdom are you sighing?
24819,你若疲倦﹐心靈沉悶悲歎﹐
24820,當告訴耶穌﹐當告訴耶穌﹔
24821,你若滿懷悲哀﹐喜樂消散﹐
24822,單要告訴主耶穌。
24823,當告訴耶穌﹐當告訴耶穌﹐
24824,祂是偉大的良友﹔
24825,無朋友或兄弟能像主耶穌﹐
24826,你若情不自禁傷心流淚﹐
24827,你若心中隱藏諸般的罪﹐
24828,你若懼怕心中愁雲圍繞﹐
24829,你若心被明日煩惱攪擾﹐
24830,你若心中切切愛慕恩主﹐
24831,你若衷心盼望基督國度﹐
24832,"Shackled by a heavy burden, 'neath a load of guilt and shame"
24833,"Then the hand of Jesus touched me, and now I am no longer the same."
24834,"He touched me, O He touched me, and O the joy that floods my soul!"
24835,"Something happened, and now I know He touched me and made me whole."
24836,"Since I met this blessed Saviour, since He cleansed and made me whole,"
24837,I will never cease to Praise Him — I'll shout it while eternity rolls.
24838,人生重擔將我枷鎖﹐滿了罪惡和羞辱﹔
24839,耶穌今來伸手一摸﹐我就立脫舊樣和罪污。
24840,祂摸我﹐哦﹐祂摸我﹐何等喜樂滿溢我心﹗
24841,奇事臨我﹐我今知道﹕祂一摸﹐我得更新。
24842,自從遇見恩主耶穌﹐得著潔淨和痊愈﹔
24843,我就不住讚美歡呼﹐歡呼直到永世不稍渝。
24844,"I am weak, but Thou art strong; Jesus keep me from all wrong;"
24845,"I'll be satisfied as long as I walk, let me walk close to Thee."
24846,"Just A closer walk With Thee, grant it, Jesus, is my plea;"
24847,"Daily walking close to Thee, let it be, dear Lord, let it be."
24848,"Thru this world of toil and snares, if I falter, Lord, who cares?"
24849,"Who with me my burden shares? None but Thee, dear Lord, None but Thee."
24850,"When my feeble life is o'er, time for me will be no more:"
24851,"On that bright eternal shore, I will walk, dear Lord, closed to Thee."
24852,我本軟弱主剛強﹐求主保守離罪網﹔
24853,心靈滿足無憂傷﹐當我走﹐求領我近祢旁。
24854,主﹐我願更親近祢﹐與主相親樂無比
24855,每日同行更親密﹐親愛主﹐求祢﹐懇求祢。
24856,經勞苦罪網世界﹐若我跌倒誰關懷﹖
24857,若有重擔誰分負﹖親愛主﹐惟有祢﹐我救主。
24858,當我脆弱今生完﹐走盡時間入永遠﹐
24859,在那光明黃金岸﹐親愛主﹐我要近祢身邊。

24877,"Who the path of sorrow hath trod,"
24878,That all of the world's great peoples
24879,"Might come to the truth of God, might come to the truth of God."

24886,基督國度就降臨地上﹐
24887,全地充滿愛與光。
24888,我們有一詩歌唱給萬邦﹐

24900,"I read in the Bible the promise of God,"
24901,That nothing for Him is too hard.
24902,Impossible things He has promised to do
24903,If we faithfully trust in His Word.
24904,Nothing is impossible when you put your trust I God;
24905,Nothing is impossible when you're trusting in His word.
24906,"Hearken to the voice of God to thee: ""Is there anything too hard for me?"""
24907,Then put your trust in God along and rest up-on His Word;
24908,"For ev'rything, Oh eve'rything, yes ev'rything is possible with God!"
24909,The word of the Lord is an anchor secure
24910,When winds of uncertainty blow;
24911,"Though man in his weakness may falter and fail,"
24912,His word will not fail us we know.
24913,"""All things are possible,"" this is His Word."
24914,"Receive it, 'tis written for you."
24915,"Believe in His promises, God cannot fail;"
24916,For what He has said He will do.
24917,從聖經中我領受寶貴應許-
24918,在神沒有難成的事；
24919,若我們能全心相信他話語，
24920,祂能做不可能的事。
24921,在神沒有難成事，正當全心倚賴祂；
24922,在神沒有難成事，正當全心信祂話。
24923,"請聽神的聲音何明朗：""在我豈有難成的事麼？"""
24924,你當專心完全靠神，安息在祂話中；
24925,每一件事，每一件事，每一件事神都必能成就！成就！
24926,因神的話語如同錨拋穩固，
24927,正當無定狂風飄搖；
24928,縱因人軟弱常會失敗傾覆，
24929,神話語永遠不動搖。
24930,"""在我凡事都能""聽你神話語，"
24931,這是為你，何不領受？
24932,神永不能失信-這是祂應許，
24933,凡祂所說，祂必成就！
24934,"Jesus, the very thought of Thee,"
24935,With sweetness fills my breast;
24936,"But sweeter far Thy face to see,"
24937,And in Thy presence rest.
24938,"Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,"
24939,Nor can the mem'ry find
24940,"A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,"
24941,O Saviour of mankind!
24942,"O Hope of every contrite heart,"
24943,"O Joy of all the meek,"
24944,"To those who fall, how kind Thou art!"
24945,How good to those who seek!

24947,Nor tongue nor pen can show;
24948,"The love of Jesus, what it is"
24949,None but His loved ones know.
24950,"O Jesus, light of all below!"
24951,Thou found of life and fire!
24952,"Surpassing all the joys we know,"
24953,And all we can desire.
24954,"No other source have we but Thee,"
24955,Soul-thirst to satisfy!
24956,Exhaustless spring! the water free!
24957,All other streams are dry.
24958,"Jesus, our only Joy be Thou,"
24959,As Thou our Prize wilt be;
24960,"Jesus, be Thou our Glory now,"
24961,And through eternity.
24962,耶穌﹐只要一想到祢﹐
24963,我心就滿甘甜﹔
24964,但這甘甜還遠不及
24965,親眼看見祢面。
24966,無口能唱﹐無心能思﹐
24967,也無記性能憶﹐
24968,一種聲音比祢名字﹐
24969,更為甘甜、可喜﹗
24970,祢是痛悔者的希望﹐
24971,溫柔者的喜樂﹔
24972,祢對尋求者何善良﹐
24973,跌倒者何仁德。
24974,但對尋得祢者如何﹖
24975,無口無筆能述﹔
24976,耶穌的愛﹐其深、其闊﹐
24977,惟被愛者略熟。
24978,耶穌﹗祢是世人之光﹐
24979,祢是生命之源﹗
24980,遠超一切我所能享、
24981,一切我所能羨。
24982,祢外我無別的源頭
24983,能解我心乾渴﹔
24984,無窮寶泉﹗活水湧流﹗
24985,別流全都乾涸。
24986,耶穌﹐祢今是我喜樂﹐
24987,將來是我賞賜﹔
24988,祢是我的榮耀、詩歌﹐
24989,從今直到永世。
24990,我能否忘快來的主﹖否﹐否﹐我心不斷想慕﹔
24991,我為祂向父神求索﹐我為祂唱早晨詩歌。
24992,來罷﹗親愛主﹗來罷﹗主﹗來罷﹗我王﹗
24993,我今能否忘了儆醒﹖否﹐否﹐我心早晚深省﹗
24994,惟恐錯過被提機會﹐容讓世俗使我聾瞶。
24995,我能否與世界結聯﹖否﹐否﹐祂召我往上面﹗
24996,願我捨棄屬地事物﹐愛祂﹐念祂﹐我的救主。
24997,願我逐日行在靈裡﹐吸取祂的生命能力﹔
24998,儆醒﹐等候﹐直到祂來﹐時刻豫備﹐不敢稍怠。
24999,願我不怕撒但權勢﹐一日在此﹐一日堅持﹔
25000,陰府的門必不得勝﹐神的基督已經執政。
25001,我能否忘這個信息﹖我要呼喊使地戰慄﹗
25002,求主成全所賜信心﹐將祢的話早日證明。

25070,主再臨豫兆日日加增﹐
25071,有如曙光漸現的早晨﹔
25072,儆醒等候即臨良辰﹐願祂今天降臨﹗

25132,如今冠以榮耀﹐坐在父右邊。
25133,永不再經歷死﹐永不再受苦。
25134,耶穌榮耀的王﹐已升至高處。
25135,祂在有福境界﹐為兒女祈求﹔
25136,呼召同進榮耀﹐並賜下恩佑。
25137,為著忠誠聖徒﹐居所已備全﹔
25138,耶穌永遠活著﹐祂愛到永遠。
25139,我主﹐我正等候你再臨﹐等候已久﹐
25140,好像這個等候無窮盡﹐一直等候不休﹔
25141,我是羨慕看見你面容﹐聽你聲音﹔
25142,我是希望能同你交通﹐比今更為相親。
25143,是否須再等幾年﹐再有幾度徘徊﹐
25144,再有幾次流淚﹐幾思念﹐然後﹐主﹐你纔回來﹖
25145,寡婦怎能在此不披素﹐回想已往﹔
25146,欲見不得﹐怎能不哀哭﹐怎不念念不忘﹖
25147,新婦怎能不因愛成病﹐切望婚期﹔
25148,如果久延無日徒引領﹐怎不連連歎息﹖
25149,教會等候你許多年代﹐從古到今﹐
25150,一世又一世一直忍耐﹐但你仍未降臨﹔
25151,我也等候你許多歲月﹐從少而老﹐
25152,同時少年次第都永訣﹐但是你仍未到。
25153,我是已經等待好疲倦﹐求你記念﹔
25154,試煉使我漸易生埋怨﹐漸易忘記奉獻。
25155,所以求你不要再遲延﹐求你快來﹔
25156,我已忍耐等候到今天﹐實在不易再捱。
25157,求你記念我的長等待﹐實難繼續﹔
25158,你若不能及時早回來﹐只好讓我前去。
25159,這久﹐這久﹐你不顯榮耀﹐留在那邊﹐
25160,無心的人已經在譏笑﹐說﹐你不是遲延。
25161,我心所有憂傷與痛楚﹐無法平息﹐
25162,任何的人不能有幫助﹐因你不在這裏。
25163,只有你來帶我進永業﹐我纔滿願﹔
25164,我要忘記路上這一切﹐當我看見你面。
25165,親愛的主！祢今召我回來，
25166,面臨祢愛，使我深覺慚愧；
25167,像我這樣，祢竟還肯愛我，
25168,阿，主，祢愛真是令人難猜！
25169,主阿，祢愛，奇妙的愛，
25170,長闊高深，真是令人難猜；
25171,雖然我曾一度叫祢傷懷，
25172,但主，祢愛郤又將我找回。
25173,我雖曾說：主阿，我深愛祢；
25174,雖曾自誇：我永不離開祢；
25175,曾幾何時，我又將祢離棄，
25176,向祢背約，使祢傷心歎息。
25177,但是，主阿，祢不因此灰心！
25178,祢那妙愛催祢將我找尋；
25179,直到尋見，懷抱我在祢心，
25180,撫我，領我，使我歸回羊群。
25181,主阿，現在我不敢離你懷，
25182,我又何敢辜負祢的恩愛；
25183,我懇求祢保守我不失敗，
25184,直到祢愛被我充分了解。
25185,"Deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus"
25186,Daily let me go;
25187,"Higher, higher in the school of wisdom,"
25188,More of grace to know.
25189,"Oh, deeper yet I pray,"
25190,"And higher ev'ry day,"
25191,"And wiser, blessed Lord,"
25192,"In Thy precious, holy Word."
25193,"Deeper, deeper! blessed Holy Spirit,"
25194,"Take me deeper still,"
25195,Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus
25196,And His perfect will.
25197,"Deeper, deeper! tho' it cost hard trials."
25198,Deeper let me go!
25199,"Rooted in the holy love of Jesus,"
25200,Let me fruitful grow.
25201,"Deeper, higher, ev'ry day in Jesus,"
25202,Till all conflict past
25203,"Finds me conqu'ror, and in His own image,"
25204,Perfected at last.
25205,進深，進深，進入耶穌大愛，
25206,每日更進深；
25207,登高，登高，在主智慧學校
25208,經歷主恩深。
25209,求主助我進深！
25210,我願登峰造極！
25211,使我悟性更新，
25212,領我進入真理。
25213,進深，進深，藉著全能聖靈，
25214,不斷的進深；
25215,直到生命消失在基督裡，
25216,溶於祂旨意。
25217,進深，進深，雖經艱難試煉，
25218,仍不斷進深；
25219,根深蒂固在主神聖愛中，
25220,結果好收成。
25221,進深，登高，每日活在主裡，
25222,直到爭戰過；
25223,靠主得勝，長成基督形像，
25224,豐富進天國。
25225,Marvel not that Christ in glory All my inmost heart hath won;
25226,"Not a star to cheer my darkness, But a light beyond the sun."
25227,"All below lies dark and shadowed, Nothing here to claim my heart,"
25228,Save the lonely track of sorrow Where of old He walked apart.
25229,"Others in the earthly sunshine, Wearily may journey on,"
25230,"I have seen a light from heaven, Past the brightness of the sun-"
25231,"Light that knows no cloud, no waning, Light wherein I see His face,"
25232,"All His love's uncounted treasures, All the riches of His grace:"
25233,"All the wonders of His glory, Deeper wonders of His love-"
25234,"How for me He won, He keepeth, That high standing all above;"
25235,"Not a glimpse-the veil uplifted- But within the veil to dwell,"
25236,Gazing on His face forever; Hearing words unspeakable.
25237,I have seen the face of Jesus- Tell me not of aught beside;
25238,I have heard the voice of Jesus- All my soul is satisfied.
25239,"In the radiance of the glory, First I saw His blessed face,"
25240,"And forever shall that glory, Be my home, my dwelling-place."
25241,哦，在榮耀裡的基督，已將我心全照亮；
25242,非像微星暗中光顧，乃是明光勝太陽。
25243,地上全是黑暗、陰影，無何能以得我心，
25244,惟祂所行艱苦途徑，值得我心來寶珍。
25245,世人乃靠屬地之光，艱苦疲困度人生；
25246,我見之光來自天上，遠勝午日放光明；
25247,毫無遮蔽，永不衰虧，使我得見祂榮面，
25248,和祂愛的無限寶貴，並祂恩典的豐滿。
25249,得見祂的奇妙榮耀，並祂更妙的奇愛；
25250,如何為我已經得到高超地位到萬代。
25251,幔子已撤，非僅一瞥，乃是幔內來安居；
25252,注視祂面，無間無歇，得聽隱密的話語。
25253,我已看見基督榮面，別事請勿向我題；
25254,我已聽見祂的恩言，這已夠使我滿意。
25255,藉祂榮耀所發光輝，可頌榮面我已見，
25256,這個榮耀且要成為，我的住處到永遠。
25257,"O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,"
25258,Tho' all things around us be trying.
25259,Tho' floods of affliction like sea billows roar;
25260,It is better to sing than be sighing.
25261,"Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore;"
25262,It is better to sing than be sighing;
25263,It is better to live than be dying;
25264,So let us rejoice evermore.
25265,When the darts of the tempter are flying.
25266,"For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore;"
25267,Our singing much more than our sighing.
25268,When sickness upon us is stealing.
25269,"No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,"
25270,For joy is the fountain of healing.
25271,For His love is love everlasting.
25272,"When we dwell with Him in the heavenly places,"
25273,There will be no more sighing and sorrow.
25274,哦，讓我們在主裏面常喜樂，
25275,雖然遭遇了誤會、猜疑；
25276,雖然患難如同衝擊的風波，
25277,但是歌唱總勝似歎息。
25278,應當時常喜樂，當時常喜樂，
25279,無論如何，歌唱總勝歎息，
25280,無論如何，生存總勝死寂，
25281,所以應當時常喜樂！
25282,雖然火箭暗中常紛飛；
25283,因為撒但還是像從前那樣
25284,懼怕讚美遠過於傷悲。
25285,雖然精神在病中消失；
25286,因主的喜樂就是你的力量，
25287,靠主喜樂你就得醫治。
25288,因主愛我們是愛到底；
25289,我們要在天家與主在一起，
25290,不再有何憂愁與歎息。
25291,"How I praise Thee, precious Saviour, that Thy love laid hold of me;"
25292,"Thou hast saved and cleansed and filled me, that I might Thy channel be."
25293,"Channels only, blessed Master, but with all Thy wondrous pow'r"
25294,"Flowing through us, Thou canst use us ev'ry day and ev'ry hour."
25295,"Just a channel, full of blessing, to the thirsty hearts around;"
25296,"To tell out Thy full salvation, all Thy loving message sound."
25297,Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me a clean vessel in Thine hand;
25298,"With no pow'r but as Thou givest, graciously with each command."
25299,"Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit, hearts that full surrender know;"
25300,That the streams of living water from our inner man may flow.
25301,我已得蒙寶血洗淨﹐嘗過天上的喜樂﹔
25302,得著生命﹐充滿聖靈﹐好使我成祢運河。
25303,主﹐我不過是祢運河﹐祢要流出祢生命﹔
25304,求祢用我﹐解人乾渴﹐無有時間無止境。
25305,不過作一祝福運河﹐運給四圍的渴人﹔
25306,運給他們救恩快樂﹐並賜滿足的父神。
25307,倒空﹐好讓祢來充滿﹐潔淨﹐好讓祢使令﹔
25308,無力﹐只有祢的能幹﹐隨祢命令來供應。
25309,救主﹐求將聖靈充滿這個已經奉獻身﹔
25310,好讓活水如河一般﹐從我裏面直流奔。

25329,親愛基督精兵﹐戰場在衝鋒﹐
25330,前曾倚賴自己﹐爭戰難得勝﹔
25331,勿再倚靠自己﹐單靠基督大力﹐
25332,在加力量者裏面﹐凡事我都能作。
25333,在你日常分內﹐站住為公義﹐
25334,是否有時厭倦﹐感到不容易﹖
25335,務要投靠救主﹐你擔﹐祂肯背負﹐
25336,路中若感疲乏﹐祂必願扶助﹐

25361,回頭信主趁此時辰﹐不被定罪﹐出死入生﹐
25362,你就可以歡然應說﹕我要永遠住在神國。

25472,"But the work we did not ask, finished humbly, just for Him."
25473,"Not the prayer we long to plead, when we bend before the Throne,"

25479,不是我們隨意走﹐乃是隨主的引領﹔
25480,那裏活水方湧流﹐那裏心中方光明。
25481,不是自擇的工作﹐就能博得他嘉許﹔
25482,乃是完成祂委托﹐纔可領受祂稱譽。
25483,不是我們隨自己﹐就能座前獻禱告﹔
25484,乃是聖靈的歎息﹐摸著更深的需要。
25485,"如果我們答應""不﹐""當他輕說""我需要﹔"""
25486,就是壇上有禮物﹐也不能使他稱好。
25487,我們如此向己死﹐與祂一同活天上﹔
25488,如此奉獻而服事﹐祂將自己作恩賞。
25489,"A mighty Fortress is our God, a Bulwark never failing;"
25490,"Our Helper He, amid the flood, of mortal ills prevailing;"
25491,"For still our ancient foe, doth seek to work us woe;"

25496,"Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He;"
25497,"Lord Sabaoth His Name, from age to age the same,"
25498,And He must win the battle.
25499,And though this world with devils filled; should threaten to undo us;
25500,"We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us;"
25501,"The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;"
25502,"His rage we can endure, for lo! His doom is sure,"
25503,One little word shall fell him.
25504,"That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them abideth;"
25505,The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him who with us sideth;

25508,His Kingdom is forever.
25509,我神乃是大能堡壘﹐永不失敗永堅固﹔
25510,致命危難密佈四圍﹐祂是我們的幫助。
25511,我們素來仇敵﹐仍然害我不息﹐
25512,詭計能力都大﹐又配狠心毒辣﹐
25513,世界無人可對手。
25514,我們若信自己力量﹐我們鬥爭必失敗﹔
25515,我們這邊有一適當合神心意的人在。
25516,如問此人名字﹐基督耶穌就是﹐
25517,就是萬軍之王﹐萬世萬代一樣﹐
25518,只有祂能得全勝。
25519,世界雖然充滿鬼魅﹐想以驚嚇來敗壞﹔
25520,我也不怕﹐因神定規真理藉我來奏凱。
25521,黑暗君王猙獰﹐我們並不戰兢﹐
25522,我忍受牠怒氣﹐因牠結局已急﹐
25523,一言就使牠傾倒。
25524,主言超越世界全權﹐神旨成功不延遲﹔
25525,藉主與我同在一邊﹐我有聖靈和恩賜。
25526,財物以及親友﹐任其損失無有﹐
25527,就是殺害身體﹐真理仍然屹立﹐
25528,神的國度永遠存。
25529,"Conflict today is fierce, the strength of Satan more;"
25530,The cry of battle calling now is louder than before.
25531,The rebel voice of hell e'en stronger now becomes;
25532,"But list, the midnight cry resounds, behold, I quickly come!"
25533,"Trials more bitter grow, the fighting doth enlarge;"
25534,Hell's forces rally all their pow'rs and gather for the charge.
25535,"Yet while we wait and watch and feel the war serve,"
25536,"We hear the joyful song ring out, Jesus, the Lord, is near!"
25537,"'Tis harder at the end the word to testify,"
25538,For Satan fights with all his pow'r our witness to defy.
25539,Much greater strength we need the foe to overcome;
25540,How happy when the Lord we see and all our sighing's done!
25541,Who then will forward go strong in His mighty pow'r?
25542,Who then will firmly trust the Lord until the vict'ry hour;
25543,"Till with the conqu'rors blest, the triumph song's begun?"
25544,"That man will then rejoice to hear, behold, I quickly come!"
25545,"Who then will choose God's best, and take the narrow track,"
25546,"Though passing thru the wildest storms, yet never turning back?"
25547,"Who now will dare press on, enduring pain and fear?"
25548,"All such will then rejoice to see Jesus, the Lord, is near!"
25549,"Though deep the darkness be we still would onward go,"
25550,Till we the day of rapture greet and glory 'round shall glow.
25551,"'Tis there we'll see the Lord, and Satan overcome;"
25552,"The overcomers will rejoice, Jesus, the Lord, has come!"
25553,今日戰爭兇猛﹐仇敵聲勢更強﹔
25554,戰場呼喊﹐殺伐之聲﹐比前更為響亮。
25555,陰府反抗之聲﹐遠比以往厲害﹔
25556,"聽哪﹐卻有夜半呼聲﹕""看哪﹐我必快來。"""
25557,今日試煉更苦﹐敵我交戰益烈﹐
25558,陰府權勢一齊鼓舞﹐集隊洶洶來劫。
25559,我在此處守等﹐更覺難以得勝﹔
25560,"卻聽傳來喜樂之聲﹕""耶穌我主已近﹗"""
25561,更難證實主話﹐在此末後之世﹔
25562,因為撒但傾力攻打﹐竭盡一切權勢。
25563,我需更大靈力﹐纔能擊敗仇敵﹔
25564,當主再來不再歎息﹐那時何等樂呢﹗
25565,誰願一直前進﹐藉著主的大能﹖
25566,誰要堅定一直相信直到戰爭全贏﹖
25567,誰要靠主壯心﹐直到得勝奏凱﹖
25568,"他要聽主歡樂之聲﹕""看哪﹐我必快來。"""
25569,誰選神的最好﹐踏上十架窄路﹐
25570,歷盡百般憂患苦惱﹐絲毫也不回顧﹖
25571,誰敢奮勇直前﹐忍受痛苦懼驚﹖
25572,"因在此時﹐歡樂可見﹕""耶穌我主已近﹗"""
25573,現今黑暗深厚﹐我們仍當向前﹔
25574,直到我們被提時候﹐榮耀正在顯現﹗
25575,在彼我們見主﹐仇敵已經失敗﹔
25576,"那時得勝者同歡呼﹕""耶穌我主已來﹗"""
25614,"I love Him, because He first loved me."
25615,"I love Him, for He set me free."
25616,"I love Him, how can I not love Him?"
25617,My Jesus He is supreme.
25618,我愛祂，因祂已先愛我；
25619,我愛祂，祂解我捆鎖。
25620,我愛祂，我怎能不愛祂？
25621,主耶穌–祂至尊大。
25692,My song shall be of Jesus;
25693,"His mercy crowns my days,"
25694,"He fills my cup with blessings,"
25695,And tunes my heart to praise.
25696,"My song shall be of Jesus,"
25697,"The precious Lamb of God,"
25698,"Who gave Himself my ransom,"
25699,And bought me with His blood.
25700,"When, sitting at His feet,"
25701,I call to mind His goodness
25702,In meditation sweet:
25703,Whatever ill betide;
25704,"I'll sing the grace that saves me,"
25705,And keeps me at His side.
25706,While pressing on my way
25707,To reach the blissful kingdom
25708,Of pure and perfect day:
25709,And when my soul shall enter
25710,"That realm of splendor fair,"
25711,A song of praise to Jesus
25712,I'll sing forever there.
25713,我的詩歌是耶穌﹐
25714,憐憫冠我一生﹔
25715,我杯充溢祂祝福﹐
25716,我心讚美不停。
25717,歌唱聲音何新﹔
25718,我的贖價是耶穌﹐
25719,寶血偉大權柄。
25720,正當安坐祂前﹔
25721,想慕祂一切良善﹐
25722,歌唱聲音何甜。
25723,任何痛苦熬煎﹐
25724,我仍歌唱恩無限﹐
25725,我永站祂一邊。
25726,當我努力向前﹔
25727,直到進入祂國度﹐
25728,有福日子久盼。
25729,我魂歡耀能居住
25730,榮耀前所未見﹔
25731,我要唱到永遠。
25732,"Pressed out of measure, press'd beyond all length;"
25733,"Pressed so intensely, seeming beyond strength;"
25734,"Pressed in the body, pressed within the soul,"
25735,Pressed in the mind till darksome surges roll.
25736,God is my hope and God is my joy;
25737,He is the resurrection life I enjoy.
25738,"Pressure by foes, and pressure from our friends;"
25739,"Pressure on pressure, till life nearly ends;"
25740,"Pressed into knowing none to help but God,"
25741,Pressed into loving both the staff and rod.
25742,"Pressed into liberty where nothing clings,"
25743,Pressed into faith for hard and hopeless things;
25744,"Pressed into life, a life in Christ the Lord."
25745,"Pressed into life, the life of Christ outpoured."
25746,壓得太緊，壓得無處可逃生；
25747,壓到極點，好像力不能勝；
25748,壓到四顧茫然，惟有獨流淚；
25749,壓得無可奈何，望絕心灰。
25750,神是我盼望，是我喜樂；
25751,是祂叫無變有，叫死人復活！
25752,壓迫在身，無處可算是平安；
25753,壓迫在心，四圍都是黑暗；
25754,迫於仇敵，有時也迫於朋友；
25755,迫上加迫，性命幾歸烏有。
25756,迫到除神之外，別無人幫助；
25757,迫到喜歡貧窮，如同豐富；
25758,迫到接受鞭杖，如同蒙雨露；
25759,迫到除主之外，別無愛慕。
25760,迫到脫塵，現今就登天逍遊；
25761,迫到無一纏累，完全自由；
25762,迫到信神來作不可能的事；
25763,迫到必須靠主而生而死。
25764,“迫得太緊！”我們如此的哭泣；
25765,迫到如此，壓迫已竭其力；
25766,壓迫餘生已非壓迫所能及；
25767,迫過之後，已得永遠安息。
25768,“迫得太緊！”實在乃是大利益；
25769,壓迫不過顯明神的手臂；
25770,迫過之後，旁觀者都要看見；
25771,迫上加迫，不會搖動一點。
25772,壓迫雖緊，我們仍舊的進前；
25773,壓迫續來，我們的望在天；
25774,壓迫續來，已經無可再壓迫；
25775,壓迫續來，心仍因神自得。
25815,"It is glory just to walk with Him whose blood has ransomed me,"
25816,It is rapture for my soul each day;
25817,It is joy divine to feel Him near where'er my path may be —
25818,"Bless the Lord, it's glory all the way!"
25819,It is glory just to walk with Him;
25820,"It is glory just to walk with Him,"
25821,He will guide my steps aright thru the vale and o'er the height —
25822,It is glory just to walk with Him.
25823,"It is glory when the shadows fall to know that He is near,"
25824,O what joy to simply trust and pray!
25825,It is glory to abide in Him when skies above are clear —
25826,"Yes, with Him it's glory all the way!"
25827,"'Twill be glory when I walk with Him on heaven's golden shore,"
25828,Never from His side again to stray;
25829,"'Twill be glory, wondrous glory with the Saviour evermore —"
25830,Everlasting glory all the way!
25831,何等榮耀﹗因主血救贖﹐我能與祂同行﹐
25832,每日歡樂在我魂湧溢﹔
25833,無論何往﹐我感祂親近就喜樂蒙引領﹐
25834,讚美主﹗一路榮耀無比。
25835,與主同行真榮耀無比﹐
25836,與主同行真榮耀無比﹔
25837,祂必引領我腳步﹐跨越山嶺經幽谷﹐
25838,與主同行真榮耀無比。
25839,何等榮耀﹗雖有黑影﹐我知道祂正同行﹐
25840,仍喜樂向祂倚靠禱祈﹔
25841,何等榮耀﹗住在主裏﹐我常見晴天無影﹐
25842,祂同行﹐一路榮耀無比。
25843,在彼黃金岸與祂同行﹐更是榮耀無比﹐
25844,不再遊蕩﹐或與祂稍離﹔
25845,何等榮耀﹗奇妙榮耀﹗我與祂永在一起﹐
25846,享榮耀直到永遠不已﹗
25847,Who is on the Lord's side? Who will serve the King?
25848,"Who will be His helpers, other lives to bring?"
25849,Who will leave the world's side? Who will face the foe?
25850,Who is on the Lord's side? Who for Him will go?
25851,"By Thy grand redemption, by Thy grace divine,"
25852,"We are on the Lord's side; Saviour, we are Thine."
25853,"Not for weight of glory, not for crown and palm,"
25854,"Enter we the army, raise the warrior psalm;"
25855,But for love that claimeth lives for whom He died:
25856,He whom Jesus nameth must be on His side.
25857,"Jesus, Thou hast bought us, not with gold or gem,"
25858,"But with Thine own life-blood, for Thy diadem;"
25859,"With Thy blessing filling each who comes to Thee,"
25860,"Thou hast made us willing, thou hast made us free."
25861,"Fierce may be the conflict, strong may be the foe,"
25862,But the King's own army none can overthrow.
25863,"Round His standard ranging, vict'ry is secure,"
25864,For His truth unchanging makes the triumph sure.
25865,Chosen to be soldiers in an alien land;
25866,"Chosen, called, and faithful for our Captain's band;"
25867,In the service royal let us not grow cold;
25868,"Let us be right loyal, noble, true, and bold."
25869,誰是在主這邊﹖誰要跟隨主﹖
25870,誰要為主活著﹐走祂的道路﹖
25871,誰要撇開世界﹐去為主爭戰﹖
25872,誰是在主這邊﹐跟隨主向前﹖
25873,藉著祢的救贖﹐並藉祢恩典﹐
25874,可愛、榮耀救主﹐我在祢這邊。
25875,參加主的軍隊﹐歡樂去爭戰﹐
25876,不是為著榮耀﹐不是為冠冕﹔
25877,乃是因著主愛激勵我向前﹐
25878,我既蒙祂恩待﹐該在祂這邊。
25879,祢已將我救贖﹐作祢的子民﹐
25880,乃是用祢寶血﹐不是用金銀﹔
25881,凡來跟從祢者﹐得福都無限﹐
25882,祢使我們甘願且自由向前。
25883,戰爭雖會兇猛﹐仇敵也強悍﹐
25884,但是主的軍隊﹐無人能擊散﹔
25885,在祂大纛之下﹐必定能得勝﹐
25886,因祂真實、不變﹐奏凱已確定。
25887,蒙主選為兵丁﹐在今世爭戰﹐
25888,我當完全忠心﹐隨元帥向前﹔
25889,如此服事我王﹐切勿變冷淡﹐
25890,守住高貴身位﹐忠貞又勇敢。
25952,"In the stars His handiwork I see,"
25953,"On the wind He speaks in majesty,"
25954,"Though He ruleth over land and sea, what is that to me?"
25955,"I will celebrate nativity,"
25956,"For it has a place in history,"
25957,"Sure, He came to set His people free, what is that to me?"
25958,"Till by faith I met Him face to face,"
25959,"And I felt the wonder of His grace,"
25960,Then I knew that He was more than just a God
25961,"Who didn't care, who live away out there,"
25962,"And now He walks beside me day by day,"
25963,"Ever watching o'er me lest I stray,"
25964,"Helping me to find that narrow way, He's everything to me."
25965,閃爍眾星展示祂手藝﹐
25966,奔馳疾風述說祂威儀﹔
25967,雖祂掌管海洋與大地﹐於我何意義﹖
25968,基督降生普世大歡喜﹐
25969,史家稱為斷代大事紀﹔
25970,祂救子民脫離眾仇敵﹐與我何關係﹖
25971,直到因信與祂面對面﹐
25972,我稍領略祂奇妙恩典﹔
25973,然後我才知道神原非高居
25974,遙遠天界﹐對人漠不關切。
25975,哦﹐今祂伴我前行每一步﹐
25976,時刻照顧免我入歧途﹐
25977,助我行走這十架窄路﹐祂是我的一切。
25978,"Have you any room for Jesus, He who bore your load of sin?"
25979,"As He knocks and asks admission, sinner, will you let Him in?"
25980,"Room for Jesus, King of Glory! Hasten now, His word obey;"
25981,"Swing the heart's door widely open, bid Him enter while you may."
25982,"Room for pleasure, room for business, but for Christ the Crucified,"
25983,"Not a place that He can enter, in the heart for which He died?"
25984,"Have you any room for Jesus, as in grace He calls again?"
25985,"O, today is time accepted, tomorrow you may call in vain."
25986,你心有空處為主嗎﹖耶穌在叩門等待﹔
25987,祂曾捨命付你罪價﹐你願否讓祂進來﹖
25988,速速將你心門大開﹐今就讓耶穌進來﹔
25989,榮耀君王站立門外﹐切莫讓祂久等待。
25990,你心有空處為事業﹐為享安樂與世福﹔
25991,耶穌為你捨命流血﹐怎為祂竟無空處﹖
25992,你心有空處為主嗎﹖耶穌慈聲再呼喚﹔
25993,"速把握""悅納時候""吧﹐明日或許已太晚﹗"
25994,"If you are tired of the load of your sin,"
25995,Let Jesus come into your heart;
25996,"If you desire a new life to begin,"
25997,Let Jesus come in to your heart.
25998,Just now your doubtings give o'er;
25999,Just now reject Him no more;
26000,Just now throw open the door;
26001,Let Jesus come into your heart.
26002,"If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,"
26003,"Fountains for cleansing are flowing near by,"
26004,"If there's a tempest your voice cannot still,"
26005,"If there's a void this world never can fill,"
26006,"If you would join the glad songs of the blest,"
26007,"If you would enter the mansions of rest,"
26008,你若願意脫離罪的苦情﹐
26009,讓耶穌來進入你心﹔
26010,你若渴慕得著新的人生﹐
26011,讓耶穌來進入你心。
26012,現在﹐將疑惑拋棄﹔
26013,現在﹐將救主投倚﹔
26014,現在﹐將心門開啟﹔
26015,若覺惡性自己不能治服﹐
26016,若感虛空世界不能滿足﹐
26017,若要黑暗變成無上光明﹐
26018,若要病痛轉為永久康寧﹐
26019,若要心中充滿快樂歡喜﹐
26020,若要全人進入平靜安息﹐
26021,"Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,"
26022,Calling for you and for me;
26023,"See, on the portals He's waiting and watching,"
26024,Watching for you and for me.
26025,"Come home, come home, ye who are weary come home;"
26026,"Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,"
26027,"Calling, O, sinner, come home!"
26028,Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading
26029,Pleading for you and for me?
26030,Why should we linger and heed not His mercies
26031,Mercies for you and for me?
26032,"Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing"
26033,Passing from you and from me;
26034,"Shadows are gathering, death-beds are coming"
26035,Coming for you and for me!
26036,"Oh, for the wonderful love He has promised"
26037,Promised for you and for me!
26038,"Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon"
26039,Pardon for you and for me!
26040,何等柔細慈愛﹐耶穌在呼召﹐
26041,呼召你﹐也呼召我﹗
26042,祂在天上等待﹐也來地尋找﹐
26043,尋找你﹐也尋找我﹗
26044,回家﹗回家﹗疲乏困倦者﹐回家﹗
26045,何等懇切慈愛﹐耶穌在呼召﹐
26046,呼召﹐哦﹐罪人﹐回家﹗
26047,為何糊塗遲延﹐不聽祂懇勸﹐
26048,懇勸你﹐也懇勸我﹖
26049,為何躊躇留戀﹐不理祂恩眷﹐
26050,恩眷你﹐也恩眷我﹖
26051,時間急急在逝﹐機會要越過﹐
26052,越過你﹐也越過我﹔
26053,陰影漸漸在集﹐死亡要來捉﹐
26054,來捉你﹐也來捉我。
26055,哦那奇妙之愛﹐祂已經應許﹐
26056,應許你﹐也應許我﹔
26057,雖然污穢敗壞﹐祂仍必憐恤﹐
26058,憐恤你﹐也憐恤我。
26059,"Jesus is tenderly calling you home,"
26060,"Calling today, calling today,"
26061,Why from the sunshine of love will you roam
26062,Farther and farther away?
26063,"Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today."
26064,"Jesus is calling the weary to rest,"
26065,"Calling today, calling today!"
26066,Bring Him thy burden and thou shalt be blest:
26067,He will not turn thee away.
26068,"Jesus is waiting, O come to Him now!"
26069,"Waiting today, waiting today!"
26070,"Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow;"
26071,"Come, and no longer delay."
26072,"Jesus is pleading, O list to His voice!"
26073,"Hear Him today, hear Him today!"
26074,They who believe on His name shall rejoice:
26075,"Quickly arise, come away!"
26076,耶穌發慈聲要召你回來﹐
26077,今日召你﹗今日召你﹗
26078,為何仍迷蒙﹐遠離主慈懷﹐
26079,終日流蕩在苦地﹖
26080,耶穌今日召你﹐今日發慈聲呼召你﹗
26081,耶穌在呼召勞者來得息﹐
26082,今日召你﹐今日召你﹗
26083,重擔卸給祂﹐無倚成有倚﹐
26084,祂要歡迎不絕棄
26085,耶穌在等待你來得赦免﹐
26086,今日等你﹐今日等你﹗
26087,可帶你罪來﹐俯伏主腳前﹔
26088,現在就來莫遲疑﹗
26089,耶穌仍呼召﹐何不就聽從﹖
26090,今日聽祂﹗今日聽祂﹗
26091,來求告祂名﹐蒙恩必無窮﹔
26092,他要賜福無復加
26093,"Jesus lingers still: 'tis for you He waits,"
26094,And He's waiting for you long;
26095,"He waits that heaven, with its fadeless joys,"
26096,May yet to you belong.
26097,"Come, and welcome, whosoever will,"
26098,"'Tis the Saviour's gracious call; He is able, willing,"
26099,"Waiting now to save, simply trust Him, that is all."
26100,"Though your wayward feet may have wandered far,"
26101,And you're deeply sunk in sin;
26102,"Yet the Saviour waits, with His patient grace"
26103,Your stony heart to win.
26104,Though His gracious call you have oft refused
26105,And He's sought your trust in vain;
26106,"Yet, with love unchanged by your cold neglect"
26107,He is seeking you again.
26108,"Oh, surrender now! Yield to love divine;"
26109,Jesus lingers for you still:
26110,"While in grace He says, ""Oh, come to Me,"""
26111,"Let your answer be, ""I will."""
26112,耶穌今留步﹐要等候你來﹐
26113,祂已等候好久長﹔
26114,祂這樣等候﹐是望你悔改﹐
26115,得享永生免滅亡。
26116,歡迎你來﹐無論甚麼人﹐
26117,這是救主的呼召﹔祂能、祂肯、祂等﹐
26118,等著施救恩﹐不過只要你信靠。
26119,你雖然不羈﹐流蕩已經遠﹐
26120,沉溺罪中已經深﹔
26121,祂仍然等候﹐忍耐著申勸﹐
26122,要得你這疲倦人。
26123,你雖已多次拒祂的恩召﹐
26124,多次使祂空眷顧﹐
26125,祂的愛不因你冷落生惱﹐
26126,今又向你來催促。
26127,你應當服降﹐服降這個愛﹐
26128,耶穌現在等候你﹔
26129,"祂既仍召呼﹕""請你就我來﹗"""
26130,"你當回應﹕""我願意。"""
26131,"I hear Thy welcome voice, that calls me, Lord, to Thee,"
26132,For cleansing in Thy precious blood that flowed on Calvary.
26133,"I am coming, Lord! Coming now to Thee!"
26134,"Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood that flowed on Calvary."
26135,"Though coming weak and vile, Thou dost my strength assure;"
26136,"Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse, till spotless all and pure."
26137,"'Tis Jesus who confirms the blessed work within,"
26138,"By adding grace to welcome grace, where reigned the power of sin."
26139,"'Tis Jesus calls me on to perfect faith and love,"
26140,"To perfect hope, and peace and trust, for earth and heav'n above."
26141,"And He the witness gives to loyal hearts and free,"
26142,That every promise is fulfilled if faith but brings the plea.
26143,"All hail, atoning blood! All hail, redeeming grace!"
26144,"All hail, the gift of Christ our Lord our strength and righteousness."
26145,祢的歡迎聲音﹐召我前來相信﹔
26146,因祢為我已流寶血﹐特要洗我良心。
26147,主﹐我來就祢﹗我今來就祢﹗
26148,求主用血將我洗﹔使我乾淨無比。
26149,我真污穢可鄙﹐行善一無能力﹔
26150,但祢歡喜賜恩幫助﹐並除一切惡跡。
26151,祢今鄭重吩咐﹐要我遠離罪途﹐
26152,虛心悔改﹐實心相信﹐豫備奔跑天路。

26192,"Perhaps today there are loving words which Jesus would have me speak,"
26193,There may be now in the paths of sin some wand'rer whom I should seek;

26207,愛主﹐要我何去﹐我就去﹐無論平地或山河﹔
26208,要我去說何語﹐我就說何語﹐要我如何就如何。
26209,也許今天就有神恩言﹐是主要我去呼喊﹐
26210,也許現在罪惡途徑間﹐有人要我去追還﹔
26211,救主﹐祢若親自來帶領﹐道路雖然暗無光﹐
26212,我的聲音要響應祢的佳音﹐
26213,要我怎講﹐我就講。
26214,在這世界廣大禾田間﹐總有我的一寸土﹐
26215,我能夠花費此生餘年﹐為著我的受死主﹔
26216,我將自己交託祢手裏﹐知道你愛我深刻﹐

26516,"Come, Lord, and give me courage, Thy conqu'ring Spirit give,"
26517,"Make me an overcomer, in pow'r within me live."
26518,"I dare not be defeated, when Jesus leads me on"
26519,To press through hellish regions to share with Him His Throne;
26520,"Come, Lord, and give Thy soldier the pow'r to wield the sword,"
26521,Make me an overcomer through Thine inerrant Word.
26522,"I dare not be defeated, just at the set of sun,"
26523,"When Jesus waits to whisper, ""Well done, beloved, well done!"""
26524,"Come, Lord, bend from the Glory, on me Thy Spirit cast,"
26525,"Make me an overcomer, a victor to the last."
26526,我不敢稍微失敗﹐因有加略在望﹔
26527,耶穌在彼曾奏凱﹐勝過黑暗君王。
26528,求主賜給我異象﹐我纔臨陣奮興﹔
26529,使我作個得勝者﹐靠著祢的大名。
26530,得勝﹐得勝者﹐都因著髑髏地。
26531,使我作個得勝者﹐因著祢﹐因著祢能得勝。
26532,我不敢稍微失敗﹐因為基督我主
26533,召我進到前線來﹐與祂一同追逐。
26534,求主賜給我膽量﹐使我剛強有力﹔
26535,使我作個得勝者﹐裏面充滿了祢。
26536,我不敢稍微失敗﹐因為耶穌領我
26537,來衝陰府的境界﹐與祂同登寶座。
26538,求主賜給你戰士有力能以揮劍﹔
26539,使我作個得勝者﹐藉著祢的聖言。
26540,我不敢稍微失敗﹐當此日西時辰﹔
26541,"因為我主正等待﹐要說﹕""好﹗我僕人。"""
26542,求主今日從天上重新賜我能力﹐
26543,使我作個得勝者﹐得勝一直到底。
26544,"Stand up for Jesus, Christian, stand! Firm as a rock on ocean's strand!"
26545,Beat back the waves of sin that roll like raging floods around thy soul!
26546,"Stand up for Jesus, nobly stand! Firm as a rock on ocean's strand!"
26547,"Stand up, His righteous cause defend; stand up for Jesus, your best Friend."

26554,站住﹐你當為主站住如同海邊磯磐穩固﹗
26555,衝擊你的罪孽狂浪﹐應當靠主大能抵擋﹗
26556,為主站住﹗剛強站住﹗如同海邊磯磐穩固﹗
26557,站住﹐維持主的見證﹗站住﹐榮耀主的聖名。
26558,站住﹐你當為主站住﹗傳揚主名﹐在海、在陸﹔
26559,將祂真道四方廣佈﹐直到全地認祂為主。

26564,I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus
26565,Since I found in Him a friend so strong and true;
26566,I would tell you how He chang'd my life completely
26567,He did something that no other friend could do.
26568,"No one ever cared for me like Jesus,"
26569,There's no other friend so kind as He;
26570,No one else could take the sin and darkness from me
26571,O how much He cared for me!
26572,"All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me,"
26573,All my heart was full of misery and woe;
26574,"Jesus placed His strong and loving arms around me,"
26575,And He led me in the way I ought to go.
26576,"Ev'ry day He comes to me with new assurance,"
26577,More and more I understand His words of love;
26578,"But I'll never know just why He came to save me,"
26579,Till some day I see His blessed face above.
26580,讓我向你述說主耶穌的寶貴﹐
26581,祂是我最忠信朋友不改變﹔
26582,讓我向你述說祂如何改變我﹐
26583,無人像祂救我脫離眾罪鍊。
26584,無人像耶穌這樣愛顧我﹐
26585,無朋友像主這樣仁愛﹔
26586,無人像祂能把我罪惡全赦免﹐
26587,主愛我何等大哉﹗
26588,當我陷在罪中﹐耶穌來尋找我﹐
26589,那時我心中充滿失望、痛苦﹔
26590,主用祂慈愛大能膀臂懷抱我﹐
26591,引導我走上那永生的道路。
26592,每一天祂重新證實祂的同在﹐
26593,使我日漸領會祂愛的無限﹔
26594,但我永不明白祂為何來救我﹐
26595,直到那日﹐當我親見祂榮臉。
26633,"O spread the tidings 'round, wherever man is found,"
26634,Wherever human hearts and human woes abound;
26635,Let ev'ry Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound:
26636,The Comforter has come!
26637,"The Comforter has come, the Comforter has come!"
26638,"The Holy Ghost from heav'n, the Father's promise giv'n;"
26639,"O spread the tidings 'round, wherever man is found —"
26640,"The long, long night is past, the morning breaks at last,"
26641,"And hushed the dreadful wail and fury of the blast,"
26642,As o'er the golden hills the day advances fast!
26643,"Lo, the great King of kings, with healing in His wings,"
26644,To ev'ry captive soul a full deliv'rance brings;
26645,And thro' the vacant cells the song of triumph rings:
26646,O boundless love divine! How shall this tongue of mine
26647,To wond'ring mortals tell the matchless grace divine —
26648,"That I, a child of hell, should in His image shine!"
26649,"Sing till the echoes fly above the vaulted sky,"
26650,"And all the saints above to all below reply,"
26651,"In strains of endless love, the song that ne'er will die:"
26652,應當傳此喜信﹐只要有人之地﹐
26653,只要有人有心﹐只要有人飲泣﹔
26654,弟兄應當殷勤﹐傳此喜樂信息-
26655,保惠師已經來﹗
26656,保惠師已經來﹗保惠師已經來﹗
26657,主的應許可信﹐聖靈已經降臨﹔
26658,只要有人之地﹐應當傳此消息﹕
26659,漫漫黑夜已逝﹐最終清曉已破﹔
26660,悲哭聲音停止﹐哀求聲音不作﹔
26661,遠山現出金絲﹐晨曦逐漸炳爍﹐
26662,請看萬王之王﹐帶有啟示大光﹐
26663,所有屬靈囚網﹐都得完全釋放﹔
26664,現今空虛監房﹐無不凱歌高唱﹕
26665,無限神聖愛疼﹐我口有何能耐
26666,向著流浪的人﹐說祢無比大愛﹗
26667,我真是個罪身﹐怎能活祢心懷﹗
26668,唱阿﹐直到回響﹐飛射上下碧蒼﹔
26669,所有眾聖在上﹐響應在下聲浪。
26670,無窮的愛提倡﹐我來引吭歌唱﹕
26671,"I remember when my burdens rolled away,"
26672,"I had carried them for years, night and day;"
26673,"When I sought the blessed Lord, and I took Him at His word,"
26674,Then at once all my burdens rolled away;
26675,"Rolled away, rolled away,"
26676,I am happy since my burdens rolled away.
26677,I am happy since my burdens rolled away!
26678,"That I feared would never leave, night or day;"
26679,"Jesus showed to me the loss, so I left them at the cross;"
26680,I was glad when my burdens rolled away.
26681,"That had hindered me for years, night and day;"
26682,"As I sought the throne of grace, just a glimpse of Jesus' face,"
26683,And I knew that my burdens could not stay.
26684,"I am singing since my burdens rolled away,"
26685,"There's a song within my heart, night and day;"
26686,I am living for my King. And with joy I shout and sing
26687,"Hellelu, all my burdens rolled away."
26688,我知何時我的罪擔全脫落﹕
26689,多年晝夜將罪擔苦背著﹐
26690,等我相信主的話﹐按祂所說接受祂﹐
26691,霎時間﹐我的罪擔全脫落﹗
26692,全脫落﹗全脫落﹗
26693,我今快樂﹐因我罪擔全脫落﹔
26694,我今快樂﹐因我罪擔全脫落﹗
26695,我知何處我的罪擔全脫落﹕
26696,當我晝夜怕罪擔不能脫﹐
26697,聖靈示我脫罪法﹐帶著罪擔就十架﹔
26698,一到彼﹐我的罪擔全脫落。
26699,我知何故我的罪擔全脫落﹕
26700,罪擔多年曾晝夜纏累我﹐
26701,等我來到恩座前﹐主的榮顏僅一顯﹐
26702,就因此﹐我的罪擔全脫落。
26703,我今歌唱﹐因我罪擔全脫落﹕
26704,心裏晝夜湧美辭﹐頌不輟﹔
26705,我今活著為我主﹐日日高唱樂歡呼﹕
26706,哈利路﹗我的罪擔全脫落。

26779,"Just as I am, and waiting not"
26780,To rid my soul of one dark blot;
26781,"To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,"
26782,"Just as I am, though tossed about"
26783,"With many a conflict, many a doubt;"

26796,自己改變比前更好﹔

26800,內有掛慮﹐外有惡行
26801,照我本相﹐貧、瞎、可憐﹐
26802,我真需要祢的恩典﹐
26803,感我惡心﹐開我盲眼﹔
26804,照我本相﹐祢肯收留﹐
26805,賜我生命﹐赦我愆尤﹔
26806,祢既應許﹐必定成就﹐
26807,真神之愛﹐偉大無窮﹐口舌筆墨﹐難以形容﹔
26808,高超諸星﹐深達地獄﹐長闊高深﹐世無相同。
26809,始祖犯罪﹐墮入引誘﹐神遣愛子拯救﹔
26810,使我罪人與神和好﹐赦免一切罪尤。
26811,阿﹗神之愛﹐何其豐富﹗偉大無限無量﹗
26812,永遠堅定﹐永遠不變﹐天使聖徒頌揚。
26813,天上諸天﹐當為紙張﹐地下萬莖﹐當為筆桿﹐
26814,世上海洋﹐當為墨水﹐全球文人﹐集合苦幹﹐
26815,耗盡智力﹐描寫神愛﹐海洋墨水會乾﹐
26816,案卷雖長﹐如天連天﹐仍難表達透暢。
26817,"But purer, and higher, and greater will be"
26818,"Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see."
26819,"Sweeter as the years go by, sweeter as the years go by;"
26820,主的愛越久越甜﹐主的愛越久越甜﹔
26821,我主因愛尋找我﹐當我罪中迷困﹔
26822,何等奇妙的恩典﹐領我歸回羊群。
26823,我主的慈愛憐憫﹐深過最深海洋﹐
26824,高過最高的蒼天﹐我要永遠頌揚。
26825,主的愛越久越深﹐主的愛越久越深﹔
26826,何等豐盛深厚﹐何等廣大長久﹐
26827,主的愛越久越深。
26828,我主生在猶太境﹐走過人生旅程﹔
26829,群眾來圍繞親近﹐為要得著救恩。
26830,傷心的人得撫慰﹐瞎眼的能看見﹔
26831,今天主偉大愛心﹐仍向我們彰顯。
26832,主有奇妙的慈愛﹐為我忍受虧損﹔
26833,甘願被釘十字架﹐毫無懷恨埋怨。
26834,但願蒙救贖聖徒﹐一同歌頌歡呼﹔
26835,直到天地都響應﹐讚美耶穌聖名。

26879,我真軟弱，極其軟弱，只能俯服祢腳前；
26880,求主聖靈來充滿我，以祢大愛溢心間。
26881,前來潔淨，祝福、安慰，以靈浸透我心魂；

27060,無論何代價要忠心。
27061,要忠心！忠心！讓此聲四面回響﹔
27062,忠心！要忠心！忠於你的榮耀王。
27063,要忠心！忠心！縱然伴侶都失敗﹔
27064,無論何境況﹐必站主一邊﹐讓主常見你忠心。
27065,從禱告小樓我們今正出發﹐
27066,五旬能力如火焚燒﹔
27067,我們獻自己向主完全降服﹐
27068,並且被聖靈來充滿。
27069,我們今往前正如主的活信﹐
27070,要傳播基督馨香﹔
27071,一舉一動要將我主來流露﹐
27072,一生一世都要忠心。
27073,從榮耀使命我們今正出發﹐
27074,有如天國所遣使者﹔
27075,我們奉差遣傳揚救主慈祥﹐
27076,在全世界每一角落。
27077,奉派去拯救黑暗憂傷靈魂﹐
27078,消除罪惡與咒詛﹔
27079,哦﹐這是如此神聖嚴肅託付﹐
27080,怎能不為主盡忠心！
27081,神聖呼召﹐榮耀顯現﹐辭別親人與愛友﹔
27082,從前無知﹐現今蒙恩﹐歡然前去報救贖﹔
27083,是神差遣！是神差遣！他們不過聽吩咐。
27084,正當他們到了異鄉﹐要用眼淚去撒種﹔
27085,野地危險﹐途中困苦﹐求使他們不放鬆﹔
27086,願主祝福！願主祝福！直至收成的歡動。
27087,有時缺少果實鼓勵﹐好像勞苦都落空﹔
27088,求向他們顯祢親密﹐扶持激勵慰苦衷﹔
27089,求與同在！求與同在！試煉之中常歌頌。
27090,有時遭遇仇敵反對﹐求使溫柔並甜美﹔
27091,若遇成功﹐有人蒙恩﹐求使他們能謙卑﹔
27092,能力充盈！能力充盈！他們纔能常得勝。
27093,今用眼淚澆灌栽培親手所撒的善種﹔
27094,舉目觀看金色遍野﹐我心不禁受感動﹔
27095,時日何短﹐大日臨近﹐主召歸家樂無窮！
27096,There are lonely hearts to cherish while the days are going by;
27097,There are weary souls who perish while the days are going by;
27098,"If a smile we can renew, as our journey we pursue,"
27099,"Oh, the good we all may do, while the days are going by!"
27100,Going by! Going by! Going by! Going by!
27101,"Oh, the good we all my do, while the days are going by!"
27102,"There's no time for idle scorning, while the days are going by;"
27103,"Let your face be like the morning, while the days are going by;"
27104,"Oh, the world is full of sighs, full of sad and weeping eyes;"
27105,"Help your fallen brother rise, while the days are going by!"
27106,"All the loving links that bind us, while the days are going by;"
27107,"One by one, we leave behind us, while the days are going by;"
27108,"But the seeds of good we sow, both in shade and shine will grow,"
27109,"And will keep our hearts aglow, while the days are going by!"
27110,正當時日悄然而過﹐就有孤寂待撫慰﹔
27111,正當時日悄然而過﹐就有疲憊告急危。
27112,願我地上的一段﹐常能助人歡顏展﹔
27113,願我常挑別人擔﹐正當時日悄然過！
27114,悄然過！悄然過！悄然過！悄然過！
27115,那有餘閒怨天尤人﹐正當時日悄然過﹔
27116,常保臉面鮮如早晨﹐正當時日悄然過。
27117,不免有人在歎息﹐不免有人心憂悒﹔
27118,我當用力來扶起﹐正當時日悄然過！
27119,愛的連索時可中斷﹐正當時日悄然過﹔
27120,忠心的人逐漸失傳﹐正當時日悄然過。
27121,但我所撒的善種﹐日長夜增漸繁榮﹔
27122,不覺我心受感動﹐正當時日悄然過！
27123,"""There shall be showers of blessing:"" This is the promise of love;"
27124,"There shall be seasons refreshing, sent from the Saviour above."
27125,"Showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need;"
27126,"Mercy drops round us are falling, but for the showers we plead."
27127,"""There shall be showers of blessing"" precious reviving again;"
27128,"Over the hills and the valleys, sound of abundance of rain."
27129,"""There shall be showers of blessing:"" Send them upon us, O Lord;"
27130,"Grant to us now a refreshing, come, and now honour Thy Word."

27133,必賜靈恩有如大雨﹐至大慈愛已應許﹔
27134,救主恩雨從上沛淋﹐我們必得大復興。
27135,恩雨﹐降恩雨！願主聖靈充滿我！
27136,雖已蒙恩略為滋潤﹐還渴望大賜恩雨。
27137,必賜靈恩有如大雨﹐至貴復興已再臨﹔
27138,高山低谷活水充溢﹐盈耳都是透雨聲。
27139,必賜靈恩有如大雨﹐聖靈已經大降臨﹔
27140,現今求來成就祢命﹐使我身心都更新。
27141,必賜靈恩有如大雨﹐此乃天父所應許﹔
27142,速來求告耶穌尊名﹐速向父神來求懇。
27143,當你苦受撒但試探﹐四圍無處不黑暗﹔
27144,邪靈勸你稍微自循﹐將來冠冕聽命運。
27145,戰士哪﹐你就當站住﹗思念你的得勝主﹔
27146,耶穌已經勝過撒但﹐故當奮勇去爭戰。
27147,當你同伴貪圖利益﹐賣主、賣友私通敵﹔
27148,你的鄉鄰譏你、欺你﹐竟同撒但聯一氣。
27149,當那仇敵用牠詭計﹐暗中為你張羅網﹔
27150,要藉世俗虛浮名利﹐使你搖動失方向。
27151,當你困於煩瑣事務﹐雖然勞碌無所補﹔
27152,損失、病痛使你艱苦﹐身靈疲憊無出路。
27153,不久﹐爭戰就要完畢﹐撒但、邪靈要受懲﹔
27154,不久﹐教會就要被提﹐要得榮耀﹐要得勝。
27155,此後﹐我王降臨地上﹐在這世界掌王權﹔
27156,此後﹐萬國都要歸降﹐敬拜耶穌並頌讚。
27157,耶穌的十字架﹐已經帶頭行﹐
27158,我們跟隨出發﹐有如祂親丁﹔
27159,基督﹐我們的主﹐帶頭向仇敵﹐
27160,我們所有步武﹐看前面旌旗。
27161,耶穌的十字架﹐已經帶頭行﹔
27162,我們跟隨出發﹐有如祂親丁。
27163,一見得勝標記﹐撒但必逃崩﹐
27164,主的親丁應即向前﹐向得勝﹔
27165,我們高聲讚頌﹐陰間基動搖﹐
27166,所以親愛弟兄﹐讚頌聲要高。
27167,基督教會出動﹐有如大軍隊﹐
27168,先聖留下腳蹤﹐我們在後隨﹔
27169,我們並非分開﹐我們乃身體﹐
27170,一信、一望、一愛所有全合一。
27171,撒但終必摧毀﹐邪靈也必衰﹐
27172,惟有基督教會﹐永遠必存在﹔
27173,陰間權勢雖劇﹐難把教會勝﹐
27174,我們有主應許﹐應許不變更。
27175,所以你們應當和我們聯合﹐
27176,你我聲音同唱得勝的詩歌﹔
27177,榮耀、尊貴、頌揚﹐歸給基督王﹐
27178,聖徒、天使同樣頌揚至無疆。
27179,撒但早已定規﹐抵敵我神的後裔﹔
27180,從軍的教會﹐當注意﹗妳已得消息。
27181,主留我們今日在世﹐原是為爭戰﹔
27182,所以若要成功神旨﹐就須上疆場。
27183,黑暗軍兵已經聚集﹐牠們已逼近﹔
27184,從軍的教會﹐當奮起﹗妳是主親民。
27185,奈何主營也有背叛﹖是誰愛世俗﹖
27186,從軍的教會不爭戰﹐怎能跟從主﹖
27187,怎樣﹖竟有儒夫不敢向仇敵挑戰﹗
27188,從軍的教會何羞慚﹐竟畏勢偷安﹗
27189,若非為我﹐便是助敵﹐此間無兩可﹔
27190,從軍的教會﹐妳到底是與誰聯合﹖
27191,那得勝者仍然得勝﹐當享祂功績﹔
27192,從軍的教會﹐當承認﹕加略是為妳。
27193,我們的主原是戰士﹐故當不避危﹔
27194,否則﹐那裏還能算是從軍的教會﹗
27195,主今呼召﹐要得勝者﹐誰站主一邊﹖
27196,從軍的教會﹐勿耽擱﹗甲胄上前線。
27197,"Grace! 'tis a charming sound, harmonious to the ear;"
27198,"Heav'n with the echo shall resound, and all the earth shall hear."
27199,All sufficient grace! E'er exhaustless grace!
27200,Christ has fixed within my heart His humble dwelling place.
27201,"Grace took the place of sin to reign within my heart,"
27202,That from the pow'r of self and sin I freely might depart.
27203,Grace taught my wandering feet to tread the pilgrim road;
27204,And new supplies each hour I meet while pressing on to God.
27205,"There is no greater grace than God who came to earth,"
27206,"God manifested in the flesh, God dwelling in my heart."
27207,恩典—美妙聲音﹗悅耳又慰人心﹔
27208,天上充滿祂的回音﹐地上也都聽聞。
27209,恩典夠我用﹗永不感力窮﹔
27210,基督活在我心中﹐在我卑微心中。
27211,恩典代罪而興﹐在我心中執政﹔
27212,使我脫離罪的權能﹐脫離敗壞天性。
27213,恩典使我腳步行在屬天路途﹔
27214,祂的供給﹐應時、豐富﹐從未將我遲誤。
27215,何能大於恩典﹗祂是神來人間﹐
27216,祂是神在肉身顯現﹐是神在我裡面。

27593,"Lord Jesus Christ, our hearts feel sweet"
27594,"Whene'er we think on Thee,"
27595,"And long that to Thy presence dear,"
27596,We soon might raptured be!
27597,"Lord, like the pretty henna flower,"
27598,In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
27599,"Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,"
27600,Admires and loves our hearts!
27601,There is no music adequate
27602,"Thy grace in full to praise,"
27603,"Nor there a heart which could enjoy,"
27604,Thy love in every phase.
27605,"Yet, what delights our hearts the most,"
27606,"Is not Thy love, Thy grace;"
27607,But it is Thine own loving Self
27608,That satisfies always.
27609,"Oh, Thou art fairer than the fair,"
27610,And sweeter than the sweet;
27611,"Beside Thee, none in heav'n or earth"
27612,Our hearts' desire could meet.
27613,哦﹐主耶穌﹐每想到祢﹐
27614,我心便覺甘甜﹔
27615,深願我能立刻被提﹐
27616,到祢可愛身邊。
27617,主﹐祢如一棵美麗鳳仙﹐
27618,顯在山野葡萄園間﹐
27619,殊姿超群﹐秀色獨艷﹐
27620,我心依依戀戀。
27621,世上並無一個妙音﹐
27622,能把祢恩盡唱﹔
27623,人間也無一顆情心﹐
27624,能把祢愛全享。
27625,但那最能使我歡喜﹐
27626,尚非祢愛、祢恩﹔
27627,乃是祢的可愛自己﹐
27628,最滿我情、我心﹗
27629,祢比美者還要更美﹐
27630,祢比甜者更甜﹔
27631,祢外﹐在天我心何歸﹖
27632,在地我心何戀﹖
27633,"Many crowd the Saviour's kingdom,"
27634,Few receive His cross;
27635,"Many seek His prize and honour,"
27636,Few would suffer loss.
27637,For the dear sake of the Master
27638,Counting all but dross.
27639,"Many long to share His glory,"
27640,Few will bear His shame;
27641,"Many long to share His power,"
27642,Few will suffer loss.
27643,Almost none would for His kingdom
27644,Count their all as dross;
27645,Count their all as dross.
27646,"Many sit at Jesus' table,"
27647,Few will fast with Him
27648,When the sorrow cup of anguish
27649,Trembles to the brim.
27650,"Few watch with Him in the garden,"
27651,Who have sung the hymn;
27652,Who have sung the hymn.
27653,"Many will confess His wisdom,"
27654,Few embrace His shame.
27655,"Many, should He smile upon them,"
27656,Will His praise proclaim;
27657,"Then if for a while He leave them,"
27658,They desert His name;
27659,They desert His name.
27660,"But the souls who love Him truly,"
27661,"Let woe come or bliss,"
27662,These will count their dearest hearts' blood
27663,Not their own but His.
27664,"Saviour, Thou who thus hast loved me,"
27665,Give me love like this;
27666,Give me love like this.
27667,眾人湧進主的國度﹐
27668,十架少人負﹔
27669,眾人爭奪主的賞賜﹐
27670,世界有誰辭﹖
27671,人雖無心走主道路﹐
27672,仍想主祝福﹐
27673,仍想主祝福。
27674,眾人都慕得主榮耀﹐
27675,羞辱少人要﹔
27676,眾人都愛同主掌權﹐
27677,損失有誰願？
27678,幾乎無人因主緣故﹐
27679,看萬事如土。
27680,多人都貪享主甘旨﹐
27681,少有願禁食﹔
27682,多人都喜登主寶座﹐
27683,少有願飄泊。
27684,同祂唱詩雖然有人﹐
27685,儆醒卻不能。
27686,眾人都想同主高貴﹐
27687,卑賤卻都畏。
27688,當主凡事為他預備﹐
27689,他就大讚美﹔
27690,當主稍微求他一點﹐
27691,就立發怨言。
27692,但那誠實愛主的人﹐
27693,禍福都不問﹔
27694,就是他們寶貴心血﹐
27695,也願為主捨。
27696,求主給我這樣心志﹐
27697,赤忠忘生死。

27703,"My help, in helpless hours;"
27704,"Most precious at all times,"
27705,Most faithful at all hours.
27706,"He is my endless joy,"
27707,Changeless as years go by;
27708,No greater love have I.
27709,祂是一切最親﹐
27710,我所一切最愛﹔
27711,人生平常所尋﹐
27712,人生終久所賴。
27713,缺乏之時﹐預備﹐
27714,無倚之時﹐扶持，
27715,所有美時﹐最美﹐
27716,無論何時﹐信實。
27717,無窮喜樂﹐原因﹐
27718,年日展開﹐不改﹔
27719,我所一切最愛。
27720,"Thy way, not mine, O Lord,"
27721,However dark it be;
27722,"Lead me by Thine own hand,"
27723,Choose out the path for me.
27724,"Thy way — Thy chosen way,"
27725,However rough it be;
27726,"'Tis Thee I seek to please,"
27727,Gladly with Thee agree.
27728,"Hold Thou my hand, Lord Jesus;"
27729,Thou knowest my weak frame.
27730,"Knowing not how to go on,"
27731,I can but sigh in shame.
27732,"If Thou wouldst hold my hand,"
27733,"Lord, whatever be Thy choice,"
27734,"Anytime, anyway, Lord,"
27735,Sweetly I will rejoice.
27736,"Smooth let it be or rough,"
27737,It will be still the best;
27738,"Winding or straight, it leads"
27739,Right onward to Thy rest.
27740,I dare not choose my lot;
27741,"I would not, if I might;"
27742,"Choose Thou for me, my God,"
27743,So shall I walk aright.
27744,"My time is in Thy hand,"
27745,Let it be soon or late;
27746,"Plan it to Thy delight,"
27747,I would not choose the date.
27748,If I should need to wait
27749,"Many a day or year,"
27750,"I want no changes made,"
27751,Nothing the way to clear.
27752,"Take Thou my cup, and it"
27753,"With joy or sorrow fill,"
27754,As best to Thee may seem;
27755,Choose Thou my good and ill.
27756,"All suff'rings shall be sweet,"
27757,If Thy wish they fulfill;
27758,"All pleasures shall be dull,"
27759,If they are not Thy will.
27760,"Choose Thou for me my friends,"
27761,My sickness or my health;
27762,"Choose Thou my care for me,"
27763,My poverty or wealth.
27764,"Not mine, not mine the choice"
27765,In things or great or small;
27766,"Be Thou my guide, my strength,"
27767,"My wisdom, and my all."
27768,求祢揀選我道路﹐
27769,我主﹐為我揀選﹔
27770,我無自己的羨慕﹐
27771,我要祢的意念。
27772,祢所命定的前途﹐
27773,無論何等困難﹔
27774,我要甘心的順服﹐
27775,來尋祢的喜歡。
27776,求祢握住我的手﹐
27777,祢知我的軟弱﹔
27778,否則我只能憂愁﹐
27779,不知如何生活。
27780,祢若握住我的手﹐
27781,不問祢是揀選
27782,何種道路和時候﹐
27783,我心都覺甘甜。
27784,不問平坦與崎嶇﹐
27785,只要是祢揀選﹐
27786,就是我所最心許﹐
27787,別的不合意願。
27788,我是不敢自作主﹐
27789,祢許﹐我也不要﹔
27790,我要聽祢遣調。
27791,我的時候在祢手﹐
27792,不論或快或慢﹔
27793,照祢喜悅來劃籌﹐
27794,我無自己喜歡。
27795,祢若定我須忍耐
27796,許多日日年年﹐
27797,我就不願早無礙﹔
27798,一切就早改變。
27799,主﹐我餘生的小杯﹐
27800,求祢隨意傾注﹔
27801,或是喜樂﹐或傷悲﹐
27802,求祢隨意作主。
27803,一切痛苦都甘甜﹐
27804,若知是祢意思﹔
27805,一切享受成可厭﹐
27806,若非祢所恩賜。
27807,求祢為我來揀選﹐
27808,健康或是疾病﹐
27809,或是笑容或淚眼﹐
27810,美名或是惡名。
27811,不論事情大或小﹐
27812,揀選﹖我是不要﹔
27813,不要自己的感覺﹐
27814,只要祢的榮耀。
27815,I hear my risen Saviour say:
27816,"“Follow me, follow me, follow me,”"
27817,"His voice is calling all the day,"
27818,"“Follow me, Follow me, follow me.”"
27819,"“For thee I trod the bitter way,"
27820,"For thee I gave my life away,"
27821,"And drank the gall thy debt to pay,"
27822,"Follow me, follow me, follow me.”"
27823,"“Tho' thou hast sinn'd, I'll pardon thee,"
27824,"Follow me, follow me, follow me;"
27825,"From ev'ry sin I'll set Thee free,"
27826,In all thy changing life I'll be.

28122,"Faith, with the star of hope glimm'ring, shall all be taken apart;"
28123,"May then Thy faith with Thy life-pow'r over me hold its full sway,"
28124,That all Thy riches of glory now I may share and for aye.

28131,站住，直到試煉過去，站住，直到風波平；
28132,站住，為著神的榮耀，站住，與主同得勝。
28133,盼望之主，祢的聲音何甜！
28134,在祢面前，我心因此暢歡！
28135,如果在我苦煉之中，我靈，我心皆衰弱，
28136,信心和那盼望之星，也都退落不閃爍；
28137,願祢信心和祢能力，盡其全力抓住我，
28138,使祢所有榮耀豐富，我可無間的嘗著。
28139,主，像清晨放明日光，驅盡所有的黑暗；
28140,並且用祢醫治光線，使我黑暗變中天。
28141,安慰之主，求祢就來，來到憂苦、疲倦心；
28142,祢這有福、榮耀盼望，哦，來與我永親近。

28202,"In store for every day,"
28203,"And though I tread a darksome path,"
28204,Yields sunshine all the way.
28205,It tells of One whose loving heart
28206,"Can feel my deepest woe,"
28207,"Who in each sorrow bears a part,"
28208,That none can bear below.
28209,有一尊名我最愛聽，
28210,我最愛唱不已；
28211,這是地上最甜之名，
28212,其音悅耳無比。
28213,我何等愛耶穌，
28214,因耶穌先愛我。
28215,這名說出救主大愛，
28216,捨命償我罪債；
28217,祂流寶血為我受害，
28218,罪人惟此是賴。
28219,這名說出父神豐富，
28220,天天賜福豐盈；

28247,任祂領我經歷火煉，
28248,背起十架，行走窄路，
28249,一直向前，必不回顧，
28250,"Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray;"
28251,This is my heart cry day unto day;
28252,I long to know Thy will and Thy way;
28253,"Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray."

28262,"My weakened will, Lord, Thou canst renew;"
28263,My sinful nature Thou canst subdue;
28264,Fill me just now with power anew;
28265,Power to pray and power to do!
28266,Thou art my pattern day unto day;
28267,"Thou art my surety, now and for aye;"
28268,教我禱告，主，教我禱告，
28269,這是我逐日迫切呼求；
28270,渴望能知祢意與道路，
28271,教我禱告，主，教我禱告。
28272,住在主裏面，主住我裏，
28273,不斷的同住，我心所祈；
28274,無論與主或與人相處，
28275,使我得能力，無限豐富。

28277,使我從禱告得著能力；
28278,眾多靈魂正沉淪失喪，
28279,求主使我得禱告能力。
28280,軟弱意志，主，祢能更新，
28281,我罪惡天性，祢能制服；
28282,用祢新能力充滿我心，
28283,禱告或行事滿有權能。
28284,逐時逐日祢是我榜樣；
28285,祢是我把握，直到永遠，
28286,"When my life work is ended, And I cross the swelling tide,"
28287,When the bright and glorious morning I shall see;
28288,"I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side,"
28289,And His smile will be the first to welcome me.
28290,"I shall know Him, I shall know Him,"
28291,"And redeemed by His side I shall stand,"
28292,By the print of the nails in His hand.
28293,"Oh, the soul-thrilling rapture when I view His blessed face,"
28294,And the luster of His kindly beaming eye;
28295,"How my full heart will praise Him for the mercy, love, and grace,"
28296,That prepare for me a mansion in the sky.
28297,"Oh, the dear ones in glory, how they beckon me to come,"
28298,And our parting at the river I recall;
28299,To the sweet vales of Eden they will sing my welcome home;
28300,But I long to meet my Saviour first of all.
28301,"Thro' the gates to the city in a robe of spotless white,"
28302,He will lead me where no tears will ever fall;
28303,In the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight;
28304,But I long t meet my Saviour first of all.
28305,當我人生工作畢，要從漲潮橫渡過，
28306,離開所有試探、煩惱和火煉；
28307,當我一登彼岸時，我必認識我救主；
28308,首先歡迎我的就是祂笑臉。
28309,我認識祂！我認識祂！
28310,當我得贖站在祂身邊；
28311,因祂手上有釘痕可見。
28312,我心要如何震動，當我見祂久慕臉，
28313,和祂慈愛發亮眼睛的光輝；
28314,我心要如何讚美祂的憐憫和恩典，
28315,這樣為我預備永遠的歡樂。
28316,我回憶多少親人，曾在河邊悲離別，
28317,現今他們向我招手去會晤，
28318,在那伊甸美麗谷，並要歌唱來迎接；
28319,但我第一羨慕是見我救主。
28320,當我進永遠門戶，身穿光明潔白衣，
28321,祂領我到永無眼淚的住處；
28322,與蒙愛者同歡唱，喜樂歌聲無窮盡，
28323,榮耀歸與真神﹐祂成就大事﹔
28324,為愛世人甚至賜下獨生子﹐
28325,獻上祂性命為人贖罪受害﹐
28326,永生門已大開﹐人人可進來。
28327,讚美主﹗讚美主﹗全地聽主聲音﹔
28328,讚美主﹗讚美主﹗萬民喜樂歡欣。
28329,哦﹐來親近父神﹐藉愛子耶穌﹔
28330,因神所成大事﹐榮耀祂不住。
28331,何等完備救恩﹐藉寶血贖價﹔
28332,凡信者可領受神應許救法﹔
28333,雖然罪孽深重﹐若真心相信﹐
28334,必立從主耶穌得赦免、潔淨。
28335,神已指教我們祂所成大事﹐
28336,歡樂何大﹐皆因耶穌-祂愛子
28337,更大、更深驚喜將震盪心靈﹐
28338,當我們得面見主耶穌榮形。
28339,何等榮耀，何等福氣，真理聖靈在我心；
28340,見證救主，啟示真理，光照安慰，並指引。
28341,充滿我！充滿我！願主聖靈充滿我；
28342,將我倒空，將我剝奪，願主聖靈充滿我。
28343,願主所說在我證實，生命聖靈釋放我；
28344,使我脫離罪律轄制，脫離死亡的壓迫。
28345,我如困鹿切慕溪水，深願聖靈解我渴；
28346,使我嘗到豐滿滋味，流出活水的江河。
28347,願我自己被置死地，使我充滿主聖靈；
28348,願我全人歸主管理，使我變成主榮形。
28349,"Since Christ my soul from sin set free,"
28350,This world has been a heav'n to me;
28351,"And mid earth's sorrows and its woe,"
28352,'Tis heav'n my Jesus here to know.
28353,"Oh, hallelujah, yes, 'tis heav'n,"
28354,'Tis heav'n to know my sins forgiv'n!
28355,"On land or sea, what matters where?"
28356,"Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there."
28357,"Once heaven seemed a far-off place,"
28358,Till Jesus showed His smiling face.
28359,Now it's begun within my soul;
28360,'Twill last while endless ages roll.
28361,What matters where on earth we dwell?
28362,"On mountaintop or in the dell,"
28363,"In cottage or a mansion fair,"
28364,"Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there."
28365,自從基督赦我罪惡，
28366,在地如天，無限歡樂；
28367,世上雖有困苦憂傷，
28368,認識耶穌就是天堂。
28369,哈利路亞，真是天堂!
28370,因我眾罪都得釋放!
28371,陸地，洋海，不論何方，
28372,耶穌同在就是天堂。
28373,從前天堂遠在天邊，
28374,今主笑臉向我展現；
28375,天堂已在我內出現，
28376,永永遠遠不會更變。
28377,無論何往，住何地方，
28378,或履平原，或越山崗，
28379,或居大廈，或住陋房，
28380,無別聲音破此靜寂﹐
28381,無別蹤跡侵擾此光景﹔
28382,只有祂美麗、寶貝的自己﹐
28383,和祂親愛的聲音。
28384,寶貝的救主﹐親愛的耶穌﹐
28385,可否求你向我說出﹕
28386,你曾為何故﹐你究是何如﹐
28387,在這安靜屬天處﹖
28388,安靜之中有祂蒞止﹐
28389,祂向我密語﹐深入我心﹔
28390,帶我進內室﹐向我表意思﹐
28391,說祂是我的愛人。
28392,在此就是天的聖境﹐
28393,不許有聲音﹐一切安靜﹔
28394,我喜樂來近我﹐渴求來飲
28395,你肯表露的愛情。
28396,在這俯伏安靜之中﹐
28397,主耶穌﹐我不敢稍動彈﹔
28398,恐有音失蹤﹐恐有語落空﹐
28399,我失你愛的片段。
28400,我魂﹐當息﹗我心﹐當足﹗
28401,你已達到最高快樂天﹔
28402,安臥你救主親愛的胸府﹐
28403,注視祂親愛笑臉。
28435,基督使我心中喜樂，
28436,基督使我口中唱歌；
28437,有祂同在就能歡唱，
28438,有祂同在就是天堂。
28439,哈利路亞，真如天堂！
28440,哈利路亞，真能歡唱！
28441,從前心身全是重擔，
28442,今日裡外都是平安；
28443,祂已赦我一切罪愆，
28444,祂已擔我一切為難。
28445,從前瞎眼，暗如夜半，
28446,今日看見，明如中天；
28447,祂已救我脫離迷途，
28448,祂今領我行走正路。
28449,從前一人寂寞孤單，
28450,今日有祂作我同伴；
28451,天天相隨，時時相偕，
28452,處處體諒，事事體貼。
28453,祂愛甘甜，激勵我走，
28454,祂恩豐滿，供應我求；
28455,祂的愛心將我拯救，
28456,祂的恩手將我保守。
28457,除祂以外，在天有誰？
28458,除祂以外，在地無歸！
28459,祂之愛我，直到萬代！
28460,我之愛祂，豈只現在？
28461,哈利路亞，永是天堂！
28462,哈利路亞，永遠歡唱！
28463,我必同祂永遠歡唱，
28464,我必同祂永在天堂！
28465,"I came to Jesus, weary, worn, and sad."
28466,"He took my sins away, He took my sins away."
28467,And now His love has made my heart so glad.
28468,He took my sins away.
28469,"He took my sins away, He took my sins away,"
28470,And keeps me singing ev'ry day!
28471,"I'm so glad He took my sins away, He took my sins away."
28472,The load of sin was more than I could bear.
28473,"He took them all away, He took them all away."
28474,And now on Him I roll my ev'ry care.
28475,"No condemnation have I in my heart,"
28476,"His perfect peace He did to me impart,"
28477,"If you will come to Jesus Christ today,"
28478,"He'll take your sins away, He'll take your sins away."
28479,And keep you happy in His love each day.
28480,He'll take your sins away.
28481,"He'll take your sins away, He'll take your sins away,"
28482,And keep you singing ev'ry day.
28483,"I'm so glad He'll take your sins away, He'll take your sins away."
28484,我到主前滿帶軟弱憂傷﹐
28485,祂除去我的罪﹐祂除去我的罪﹔
28486,今祂大愛使我心滿歡暢﹐
28487,祂除去我的罪。
28488,祂除去我的罪﹐祂除去我的罪﹐
28489,使我天天喜樂高歌﹔
28490,真快樂﹐祂除去我的罪﹐祂除去我的罪。
28491,罪惡重擔過於我所能負﹐
28492,我到主前卸下我眾憂苦﹐
28493,不再定罪﹐我心不再有虧﹐
28494,主賜平安﹐今充滿我心內﹐
28495,若你今天願來就主耶穌﹐
28496,祂必除去你罪﹐祂必除去你罪﹔
28497,使你終日在祂愛裏歡呼﹐
28498,祂必除去你罪。
28499,祂必除去你罪﹐祂必除去你罪﹐
28500,使你天天喜樂高歌﹔
28501,真快樂﹐祂必除去你罪﹐祂必除去你罪。
28502,"I once was lost in sin's dark night,"
28503,"God's love I spurned, I wandered from the right,"
28504,"Rejecting Him, I knew not why,"
28505,The One who for my soul did bleed and die.
28506,"He ransomed me, from sin He set me free,"
28507,He paid my debt on rugged Calvary;
28508,"He's taken all my sin and guilt away,"
28509,And turned my darkness into day.
28510,I never dreamed I could possess
28511,Such peace and joy as now is in my breast;
28512,The Christ who set my poor soul free
28513,Can save your soul and give you victory.
28514,以前我迷失在罪途﹐
28515,輕慢主愛﹐遠離公義正路﹔
28516,我真不知為何拒絕﹐
28517,捨身流血愛我靈的耶穌。
28518,祂救了我﹐從罪中釋放我﹐
28519,在各各他為我付上代價﹔
28520,我一切罪主已完全赦宥﹐
28521,使我黑夜變為白晝。
28522,我真永遠夢想不到﹐
28523,我能得到這樣平安喜樂﹔
28524,基督已拯救我靈魂﹐
28525,也能救我勝過一切罪惡。

28558,"Once I was bound by sin's galling fetters,"
28559,"Chained like a slave I struggled in vain,"
28560,But I received a glorious freedom
28561,When Jesus broke my fetters in twain.
28562,Glorious freedom! Wonderful freedom!
28563,No more in chains of sin I repine!
28564,"Jesus, the glorious Emancipator!"
28565,Now and forever He shall be mine.
28566,"Freedom from all the carnal affections,"
28567,"Freedom from envy, hatred and strife,"
28568,"Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions,"
28569,Freedom from all that saddened my life.
28570,Freedom from pride and all sinful follies;
28571,Freedom from love and glitter of gold;
28572,Freedom from evil temper and anger-
28573,"Glorious freedom, rapture untold!"
28574,我曾被罪惡鎖鍊之捆綁﹐
28575,像奴不自由﹐痛苦難當﹔
28576,但耶穌斷開我一切鎖鍊﹐
28577,榮耀之救恩﹐使我釋放。
28578,榮耀之釋放﹗奇妙之釋放﹗
28579,我再無罪惡束縛痛苦﹔
28580,榮耀釋放者是救主耶穌﹐
28581,從今到永遠﹐使我釋放。
28582,主使我脫離情慾和嗜好﹐
28583,脫離我妒忌﹐恨惡狂傲﹔
28584,脫離我世俗虛空之幻想﹔
28585,亦使我離去一切憂勞。
28586,主使我脫離驕傲和愚昧﹐
28587,脫離我溺愛金錢迷惑﹔
28588,脫離我惱怒﹐暴躁之性情﹔

28595,He walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.
28596,"He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!"
28597,You ask me how I know He lives? He lives within my heart.
28598,"In all the world around me I see His loving care,"

28613,你問我怎知主活著?因祂活在我心。
28614,紛亂世事圍繞中﹐我見祂的慈容﹔
28615,雖然我心感疲倦﹐但永不會失望。
28616,一切狂怒風潮中﹐我知主正引領﹔
28617,直到那日祂顯現﹐至終降臨﹗

28622,"All that we were — our sin, our guilt,"
28623,Our death was all our own;
28624,"All that we are we owe to Thee,"
28625,Thou God of grace alone.
28626,"Thy mercy found us in our sins,"
28627,"And gave us to believe,"
28628,"Then, in believing, peace we found,"
28629,And in Thy Christ we live.
28630,"All that we are, as saints on earth,"
28631,"All that we hope to be,"
28632,"When Jesus comes and glory dawns,"
28633,We owe it all to Thee.
28634,"O God, how rich, how vast Thy love,"
28635,Whoe'er can Thee repay?
28636,"Thy love is past man's finding out,"
28637,Thy grace no man can say.
28638,"But Lord, to me I pray Thee grant,"
28639,"More clearly may I see,"
28640,That I may e'er more fully know
28641,How much I owe to Thee.
28642,But if man's heart should e'er suppose
28643,"He could repay Thy love,"
28644,It only means he nothing knows
28645,"Of love, all loves above."
28646,So may we never bargains make
28647,With that dear love of Thine;
28648,"The love that made Thine heart once break,"
28649,Whoe'er that love could win?
28650,"Then nevermore suggest return,"
28651,His love is far too high;
28652,But let our hearts with rapture burn
28653,That He for us should die.
28654,"O Father God, we owe Thee all!"
28655,All that we are and have!
28656,"With grateful thanks before Thee fall,"
28657,'Tis all that we can give.
28658,我們從前所有，
28659,不過就是死亡、罪惡；
28660,我們現今所有福分，
28661,都是來自我神。
28662,我在罪中，祢愛來尋，
28663,感動我心相信；

28666,我為聖徒，現在所享，
28667,和我將來盼望，
28668,無一是我自已配得，
28669,都是因祢恩澤。
28670,主，祢這樣豐富的愛，
28671,誰能還清這債？
28672,祢愛真是超人意外，
28673,神聖！不可疑猜！
28674,哦主但願祢今使我，
28675,時刻明白更多：
28676,像祢這樣寬大的主，
28677,我當永作債戶。
28678,我心若說要報主恩，
28679,聊以表明微忱，
28680,我就還是不知祢恩，
28681,究有多闊多深。
28682,但願我們對祢恩愛，
28683,不致當作買賣；
28684,祢為我們所歷艱辛，
28685,我們怎能報盡。
28686,因此我們不再說報
28687,祢恩實是太高—
28688,我們惟有滿心感戴，
28689,樂意永遠負債。
28690,哦，主耶穌，我們欠祢，
28691,一切都欠了祢，
28692,我們只好一面感激，
28693,一面因祢安息。

28736,我今能終日居留
28737,神至高至聖之境﹐
28738,我要從外幔經過﹐
28739,神亮光在此蘊藏﹐
28740,藉寶血我能進入
28741,至聖地何等光明﹗
28742,敵權勢全已失踪﹐
28743,我今活至聖境內﹐
28744,我已從內幔經過﹐
28745,我已經成聖歸神﹐
28746,藉寶血偉大權能﹐
28747,主作我永遠居所﹐
28748,"Consider now, dear ones, the life of a grapevine."
28749,"It has no easy life, its hardships intertwine;"
28750,"Unlike wild flowers in the field that gayly, wildly bloom,"
28751,"In countless patterns up they grow, full liberty assume."
28752,The flowers of the vine are plain and small in size;
28753,"So humbly do they bloom, unnoticed by most eyes."
28754,"The time for blossoms is so short, soon into fruit they grow."
28755,"No charm is there for them to boast, no elegance to show."
28756,"So fastened to a post, it cannot freely grow;"
28757,Up to the trellises its branches tied must go.
28758,From stony soil the vine is forced to draw its food supply;
28759,"It has no way to change its course, or from its hardship fly."
28760,How lovely is the green of Spring's beautiful scene!
28761,"So natural is its growth, with brightness so serene."
28762,"Out of the vine's abundant life so full and so complete,"
28763,"Against the azure, branches flow to taste the air so sweet."
28764,"Behold, the master comes His guidance to provide;"
28765,"The pruning knife he brings to strip it of its pride,"
28766,"Not minding all its tender shoots, to cleanse and cleanse again,"
28767,Till all excessive branches fall to comply with his plan.
28768,"During this time of loss, dare it self-pity show?"
28769,"No, no, it yields but more to him who wounds it so,"
28770,"Yes, to the hand that strips it of all glory and all pride."
28771,The vine thus keeps the strength of life that much fruit may abide.
28772,"To hardened wood is turned each stump of bleeding shoot,"
28773,And each remaining branch brings forth abundant fruit.
28774,"Scorched by the burning sun, its leaves turn dry and fall away."
28775,The fruit thus ripens more and more until the harvest day.
28776,"Due to the fruitful load, the branches are brought low,"
28777,The consequence of pain and many a thoughtful blow.
28778,"In bearing clusters of fine fruit, comforted it must be;"
28779,"But soon will come the harvest time, the days of comfort flee."
28780,Upon the hand-picked fruit comes treading of the feet.
28781,The greatest treasure lies where grapes and wine-press meet.
28782,"When grapes are crushed inside the press, red wine begins to flow,"
28783,Like surging rivers bringing joy the earth to overflow.
28784,"So barren is the vine, its all is spent in full,"
28785,And now its plight again is dreary night and woe.
28786,No one would stoop to thank the vine for cheering wine that's drunk;
28787,"Instead, more stripping is at hand to make a branchless trunk."
28788,"Throughout the winter time, its wine gives warmth, and cheers"
28789,The shiv'ring ones whose chill is mixed with grief and tears.
28790,"But midst the ice and snow without, the vine is thus to stand."
28791,Why does it strive to bear it all? It's hard to understand.
28792,"When winter's o'er, it yearns once more much fruit to bear."
28793,New shoots come forth again to weave its garment fair.
28794,It has no murm'ring or complaint for winter's sore abuse.
28795,"Its all it gives, and still wills not its off'ring to reduce."
28796,"It stretches up toward heav'n, and breathes the fresh clean air."
28797,"Untouched by earthly joy, self-love it does not bear."
28798,"It smiles at sacrifice ahead, accepting odds once more;"
28799,"As if no strokes, no stripping sore can it ever recall."
28800,Much sap and wine and blood out from its branches flow.
28801,Does emptying itself cause it more poor to grow?
28802,"From it, drunkards and wanderers do drink and merry make."
28803,"Do they, from pleasure much, become more wealthy when they wake?"
28804,"Measure your life by loss, never measure by gain;"
28805,"Not by much wine consumed, but wine poured out in pain."
28806,The strength of love stands ever in love's sacrifice to show.
28807,"The more one suffers, then the more true love can he bestow."
28808,He who spares not himself is best for God to gain;
28809,Who hurts himself the most can best soothe those in pain.
28810,"Unless well-learned in being stripped, a sounding brass is he."
28811,"Unless averse to saving self, ne'er can he blissful be."
28812,我們現在默思，葡萄一生的事：
28813,其路並不容易，其境也不安逸；
28814,不像，不像野地野花，隨地隨意吐華，
28815,生成，生成曲徑迷堂，生成款式百樣。
28816,反之葡萄開花，非常渺小無華，
28817,人幾不能辨省，牠竟也曾有英；
28818,花未，花未開得一日，即已結為果實，
28819,不得，不得成為驕葩，自感丰姿可誇。
28820,牠是拴在樁上，不能隨意生長，
28821,牠如伸肢展臂，也是架上被繫；
28822,牠就，牠就從了礫土，吸取牠的食物，
28823,道路，道路不能揀選，不能想要變遷。
28824,是的，綠衣秀美，春地披上明媚，
28825,因著生命豐裕，自然生長有餘；
28826,滿身，滿身嫩枝細苗，開始飄浮盤繞，
28827,在於，在於青藍空中，得嘗甘美無窮。
28828,但是園主園工，對牠並不放鬆，
28829,帶著刈剪修刀，要剝牠的驕傲；
28830,毫不，毫不顧惜細嫩，將牠割到標準，
28831,所有，所有多餘美穗，都被斷折破碎。
28832,在牠損失期間，牠並不敢自憐，
28833,乃是反將自己，更為完全徹底；
28834,交給，交給剝奪所有，使牠虛空的手，
28835,牠力，牠力不肯損失，一切都為結實。
28836,那些流血的枝，漸變堅硬木質，
28837,那些存留的穗，也漸結果纍纍；
28838,太陽，太陽迫牠枯乾，牠葉開始落散，
28839,使牠，使牠果子盛紫，直至收成日子。
28840,牠因負重過甚，致牠無枝不沉-
28841,這是長期努力，受盡琢磨來的-
28842,現今，現今果已全美，自然牠可自慰；
28843,但是，但是收成已到，欣慰日子已少。
28844,有手要來摘下，有腳要來踐踏，
28845,葡萄所有寶藏，在於酒醡之上，
28846,直到，直到豐富紅酒，有如長江大流，
28847,源源，源源滾湧不息，喜樂遍滿全地。
28848,但是葡萄形狀，乃是剝光淒涼，
28849,已經給了一切，又將進入黑夜；
28850,無人，無人向牠償還，牠所給人醉歡，
28851,反而，反而將牠再砍，成為無枝禿幹。
28852,然而全冬之間，牠酒卻賜甘甜，
28853,給那寒冷之中，憂鬱愁苦之眾；
28854,但牠，但牠卻在外面，經歷雪地冰天，
28855,前來，前來忍受一切，一切何其難解。
28856,直到寒冬已過，牠又豫備結果，
28857,重新萌芽生枝，再來放綠成姿，
28858,不因，不因所受磨難，心中埋怨不甘，
28859,不因，不因損失無限，而欲減少奉獻。
28860,牠的所有呼吸，盡是高天清氣，
28861,並不半點沾染不潔屬己情感；
28862,面向，面向犧牲含笑，再來接受雕削，
28863,有如，有如從未遇過損失或者折磨。
28864,葡萄從牠肢枝，流酒、流血、流汁，
28865,是否因己捨盡，牠就變為更貧？
28866,世上，世上醉人浪者，從牠暢飲、作樂，
28867,他們，他們是否享福？能否變為更富？
28868,估量生命原則，以失不是以得；
28869,不視酒飲幾多，乃視酒傾幾何；
28870,因為，因為愛的能力，是在愛的捨棄；
28871,誰苦，誰苦受得最深，最有可以給人。
28872,誰待自己最苛，最易為神選擇；
28873,誰傷自己最狠，最能擦人淚痕；
28874,誰不，誰不熟練剝奪，誰是鳴鈸響鑼；
28875,誰能，誰能拯救自己，誰就不能樂極。
28876,"Thou hast said Thou art the Vine,"
28877,"Lord, And that I'm a branch in Thee,"
28878,But I do not know the reason
28879,Why I should so barren be.
28880,"Bearing fruit is my deep longing,"
28881,"More Thy life to manifest,"
28882,"To Thy throne to bring more glory,"
28883,That Thy will may be expressed.
28884,"But I fail to understand, Lord,"
28885,"What it means-“abide in Me,”"
28886,"For the more I seek “abiding,”"
28887,More I feel I'm not in Thee.
28888,How I feel I'm not abiding;
28889,"Though I pray and strongly will,"
28890,"Yes from me Thou seemest distant,"
28891,And my life is barren still.
28892,"Yet Thou art the Vine, Thou saidst it,"
28893,And I am a branch in Thee;
28894,"When I take Thee as my Saviour,"
28895,Then this fact is wrought in me.
28896,Now I'm in Thee and I need not
28897,"Seek into Thyself to come,"
28898,"For I'm joined to Thee already,"
28899,With Thy flesh and bones I'm one.
28900,"Not to “go in” is the secret,"
28901,But that I'm “already in!”
28902,"That I ne'er may leave I'd ask Thee,"
28903,Not how I may get within.
28904,"I am in, already in Thee!"
28905,What a place to which I'm brought!
28906,"There's no need for prayer or struggling,"
28907,God Himself the work has wrought.
28908,"Since I'm in, why ask to enter?"
28909,O how ignorant I've been!
28910,Now with praise and much rejoicing
28911,"For Thy Word, I dwell therein."
28912,"Now in Thee I rest completely,"
28913,With myself I gladly part;
28914,"Thou art life and Thou art power,"
28915,All in all to me Thou art.
28916,我主，祢說祢是真樹，
28917,我是祢的真枝子；
28918,但我不知為何緣故，
28919,我是如此不結實。
28920,我心羨慕結果更多，
28921,更能彰顯祢生命；
28922,更能榮耀歸與寶座，
28923,更能禱告得答應。
28924,但是，主阿，我不明白，
28925,"""常在裏面""的聖言；"
28926,"我越追求要去""常在，"""
28927,我越發現在外邊。
28928,我不覺得我在裏面，
28929,我也禱告並立志！
28930,但祢都像隔開很遠，
28931,生命仍然無果子。
28932,但祢是說，祢已是樹，
28933,我也已是祢枝子；
28934,當我信祢作我救主，
28935,聖靈已成此事實。
28936,我今已是在祢裏面，
28937,再也不必求加入；
28938,我是已經與祢結聯，
28939,完全合一的骨肉。
28940,"祕訣不是要我""去在，"""
28941,"事實是我""已在""內；"
28942,所求乃是不要離開，
28943,不是如何得地位。
28944,我已在內，已在祢內！
28945,這是神作的事實！
28946,不必禱告，不必作為，
28947,乃是神手的設施。
28948,我已在內，怎求入內？
28949,我是何等的愚昧；
28950,現今我只歡樂讚美，
28951,相信聖言的無偽。
28952,我今只有完全安息，
28953,知道祢是我一切；
28954,祢是生命，祢是能力，
28955,而我一切都了結。
28956,"When I am in the natural man,"
28957,How very strong I feel I am;
28958,"I do not know, I cannot scan,"
28959,How very weak I am.
28960,"When in the world I have my life,"
28961,"I cannot sense my failure rife,"
28962,"But boasting in my earnest strife,"
28963,Proudly I forward press.
28964,"When I within the darkness dwell,"
28965,My shallow state I cannot tell;
28966,"I only think how I excel,"
28967,Needing no modesty.
28968,"But when at last I come to Thee,"
28969,Thy searching light uncovers me;
28970,I see what I could never see —
28971,My ugly self exposed.
28972,"Wither'ng beneath Thy scorching ray,"
28973,I find my all fading away.
28974,"My self-esteem in dust I lay,"
28975,My weakness I embrace.
28976,There's not a thing that pride can claim;
28977,There's not a member but is lame;
28978,There's only deep regret and shame;
28979,"O Lord, how can I pray?"
28980,Thy blood from judgment sets me free;
28981,Thy life from doom delivers me.
28982,"How filthy yet I still must be,"
28983,In shame my head I bow.
28984,"In blindness I'm puffed up with pride,"
28985,Thinking no need the facts to hide.
28986,"My self-conceit has multiplied,"
28987,While I in darkness boast.
28988,"Whether I stay or move along,"
28989,"Whate'er I say, I'm always wrong!"
28990,"So weak am I and never strong,"
28991,Nothing I do is right.
28992,"I want to pray, but faith have not,"
28993,"I fain would seek Thee as Thou art,"
28994,"Oh, canst Thou e'er renew my heart,"
28995,"Have mercy, Lord, on me!"
28996,當我憑著自己思想，
28997,我覺自己很是剛強；
28998,不知自己卻是怎樣
28999,沒有力量。
29000,當我生活世人中間，
29001,我就不覺自己虧欠；
29002,只覺自己如何奮勉，
29003,如何上前。
29004,當我住在黑暗裏面，
29005,我就不知自己浮淺；
29006,以為自己何等無限，
29007,不必虛謙。
29008,當我來到祢的面前，
29009,亮光刺破遮蔽幕簾；
29010,我就看見前所未見，
29011,完全露現。
29012,在祢面前我只萎縮，
29013,一切萎縮、一切消沒；
29014,所有驕傲都變軟弱，
29015,都變赤裸。
29016,沒有可驕，沒有可傲，
29017,沒有可依，沒有可靠；
29018,只有自慚，只有自懊，
29019,能否禱告？
29020,幸有祢血免我定罪，
29021,祢的生命免我銷燬；
29022,但我真是何等污穢，
29023,何等慚愧。
29024,所有驕傲都是愚昧，
29025,看見實在，何必謙卑；
29026,所有自恃都是因為
29027,心中墨黑。
29028,靜，我也錯；動，我也錯；
29029,不說，不安；說，又太過；
29030,都是失敗，都是軟弱，
29031,都是不妥。
29032,我要禱告，沒有信心，
29033,我要倚靠，如何求尋？
29034,不知如何方能重新…
29035,主阿，憐憫！
29036,一生聰明未遇敵手，以掃、以撒均成往事；
29037,我今到了生死關頭，雖然絕望仍然自恃；
29038,束手就縛我不能受，我要用力，我要用謀。
29039,彷彿我見有人偷營，我心害怕但我倔強：
29040,惟恐我的末日已定，用盡全身所有力量；
29041,祂來摔跤，我要招架，未到死地還要掙扎。
29042,奇哉！我用已往經驗，摔跤一夜祂仍不倒；
29043,我的力量眼見將減，但是祂像無意回報；
29044,奇哉！又像無法脫身，我的膽量又復加甚。
29045,如此對手從未得會，祂雖告我祂的名字，
29046,我仍不知所戰為誰，只知祂有很大賞賜；
29047,我就迫祂向我賜福，迫祂向我賜福、屈服。
29048,天已黎明難分勝負：好像無法，好像無能，
29049,祂就被迫向我賜福，並且稱許，說我得勝，
29050,說我新名是以色列；當我起來，我腿已瘸！
29051,有了微光進我暗心，開始照亮使我領會：
29052,若我有能，為何扭筋？若我得勝，為何瘸腿？
29053,是祂得勝留下記號，使我愚昧受了警告。
29054,瞬息之間，光滿我心，如同洪流沖破堤防，
29055,我就看見榮耀無盡，迫我敬拜，迫我隱藏；
29056,我纔知道我的大罪，我的不軌，我的污穢。
29057,哎阿，想到我曾勝過造物的主，全能的神！
29058,荒謬之極，該當有禍！該死之至，該死無恩！
29059,我這雙手竟然背叛，強迫主神不得動彈！
29060,祢是何等榮耀的神，萬軍之主何等顯赫！
29061,我一認識祢是誰人，並一看見祢是如何，
29062,我要長號，我要流淚，我要懊悔，我要下跪。
29063,怎麼可能，怎麼可以見神的面，與神相持！
29064,我恨不得有縫入地，纔可稍微掩我羞恥：
29065,為何我不在此以先，即已毀滅，離世長眠？
29066,我恨自己過於昏沉，因為驕傲瞎了眼睛；
29067,想到我是得勝了神，我就不禁膽戰心驚：
29068,渾身無力，何只一腿？百節俱脫，全人崩潰！
29069,我今回顧我的一生，全是充滿敗壞事體：
29070,保全自己，將神犧牲，愚昧的心只知快意；
29071,我還以為祝福在於強神來聽我的所欲。
29072,我有欲望，天來順服，我出主張，天來安排，
29073,我有喜好，望神讓步，我有工作，望神領帥；
29074,我若急切，天須趕快，那有一次神不失敗。
29075,世界竟有如此邪惡：驕傲、頑固、詭詐的人！
29076,主，祢知道我是雅各，充滿敗壞，充滿可恨；
29077,我無可望，只望憐憫，祢來憐憫敗壞這心。
29078,我今已蒙憐憫一摸，舉步蹣跚、恩典遺跡；
29079,我若忘記，新的腿窩要使我感何等無倚；
29080,祢雖許我作以色列，但是雅各永遠病瘸。
29081,主，我服了，是祢得勝：因祢失敗我求失敗，
29082,因我得勝我來投誠，祢的軟弱領我下拜；
29083,我願一生戰戰兢兢行祢旨意，榮耀祢名。
29084,當我蒙恩能夠施恩，可憐，我竟自己知道；
29085,我是如何超越本分，自己覺得，自己記牢；
29086,我想我是活在神前，但我暗許自己敬虔。
29087,我的一生充滿試煉，大至不是常人可忍；
29088,人雖不知我的苦艱，我卻知道自己堅靭；
29089,我想我是丟棄自己，但我不忘自己經歷！
29090,我知我是滿受恩惠，已至地上無人似我；
29091,在我身上，在我心內，我能尋出神的工作；
29092,神的工作在我身上，我全知道如何欣賞。
29093,我知我的所有登造，我知我的一切善義；
29094,不知不覺我覺自豪，中心從神移到自己；
29095,我的手中隔夜嗎哪，已變臭壞，已被蹧蹋。
29096,當有朋友向我慰問，向我苦情表示同情；
29097,我的驕傲不再隱悶，我的忍耐立即空罄；
29098,我就失敗如同常人，咒詛生日顯出根本。
29099,神阿，我是風聞有祢，講祢論祢，我是都能；
29100,但是我的敗壞自己，從未因祢有何變更；
29101,我用祢賜，固我驕傲，我因祢恩，加我自高。
29102,但我現今親眼見祢，祢的聖潔顯我污穢，
29103,祢的亮光使我傾圯，祢的榮耀使我痛悔；
29104,使我痛悔我怎能以，對我自己如此著迷？
29105,何等慚愧，何等慚愧，將祢恩典裝飾自己！
29106,高抬自己用祢作為，無一動機不是可鄙；
29107,我的失敗不可收拾，我的得勝更為羞恥。
29108,何等羞恥，我能驕傲！何等瞎眼，我能愚昧！
29109,污穢，竟會以為潔好，肉體，竟會以為佳美；
29110,我是何等無知自義！我偷多少榮耀歸己！
29111,祢早知我何等敗壞，但我竟然一無所知，
29112,竟然以為自己可賴，豈知乃是十分可恥；
29113,主阿，可否求祢救我，今天為我開此捆鎖？
29114,主阿，我心是在希望能有塵土給我躺臥，
29115,能有爐灰撒我身上，讓我懊悔我的墮落；
29116,我是羞恥，羞恥無盡，我有如此敗壞的心。
29117,我的言語何等不準，我的生命何等膚淺，
29118,我的存心無不濁溷，我的一切無不可厭；
29119,我今恨惡我的自己，主阿，我的希望在祢。
29120,我今俯伏主面前﹐我希奇主恩典﹗
29121,像我這樣的罪魁﹐主竟拯救歸回﹗
29122,我本罪人貪世福﹐那裡想到要主﹔
29123,為何無端來尋我﹐用愛圍繞著我﹖
29124,當時我心因罪惡﹐糾纏得真難過﹔
29125,但我並未求解脫﹐祢卻前來尋我﹗
29126,當時我雖聽見祢﹐但我總是不理﹔
29127,並且多次反對祢﹐實是祢的仇敵。
29128,我實不知為何故﹐祢竟為我罪辜﹐
29129,釘死在十字架上﹐使我得著平康﹗
29130,我的罪惡比人多﹐我為肉體而活﹐
29131,我的性情比人壞﹐祢為什麼要愛﹖
29132,祢生馬槽何寒微﹗祢的生活何卑﹗
29133,祢到加略受折磨﹗祢的全是為我﹗
29134,祢在何處看上我﹖為何又愛上我﹖
29135,所以才如此受苦﹐為要使我得福﹖
29136,我比別人有何長﹖有何比人高尚﹖
29137,因此使祢離天上﹐為我十架命喪﹖
29138,主阿﹐當我想自己﹐實在無一可以
29139,邀祢青眼﹐使祢喜﹐我就只得希奇﹗
29140,無他﹐我今只能說﹕祢是無故愛我﹗
29141,哦﹐祢是無故愛我﹗哦﹐這恩真難說﹗
29142,哦﹐不是因自己好﹐不是因自己高﹔
29143,乃是祢要愛罪魁﹐無故的愛罪魁﹗
29144,我既如此的蒙恩﹐自然應當認真
29145,愛祢、念祢、順服祢﹐才可對得住祢﹔
29146,但是﹐可憐到如今我心仍冷如冰﹗
29147,雖然明知祢恩愛﹐仍是對祢懈怠﹗
29148,祢雖為我捨性命﹐我對祢仍無情﹔
29149,祢雖為我離天庭﹐我對祢只半心。
29150,隱藏世界離不得﹐祢道路嫌太窄﹗
29151,微小自己捨不得﹐祢生命苦太默﹗
29152,當我想到這裡時﹐我心若有所失﹔
29153,自恨性情太敗壞﹐自恨生活太歹。
29154,但是﹐主﹐祢豈不知我心將要如此﹗
29155,祢既豫知我心冷﹐當初何必施恩﹖
29156,難道祢為我捨命﹐擔當痛苦、罪、病﹐
29157,受盡人世的艱辛﹐就是為此冷心﹗
29158,祢既知道我如此﹐何苦為我受死﹖
29159,祢既知道我無良﹐何竟為我受傷﹖
29160,祢雖豫知我冷淡﹐對祢刻變時翻﹔
29161,但祢仍然要愛我﹐為我死﹐為我活。
29162,當我想到這樣愛﹐不知淚從何來﹔
29163,滿心感激我救主﹐希奇祢的無故﹗
29164,主阿﹐對於祢大愛﹐我真明白不來﹔
29165,一面我希奇不迨﹐一面我要敬拜。
29166,天上福樂雖無比﹐我心並不在彼﹔
29167,我愛作個唱詩人﹐讚美我主我神。
29168,在那光明榮耀中﹐我要不住稱頌﹔
29169,我要感謝祢恩愛﹐我要永遠敬拜。
29170,我望我能在天城﹐作主恩愛標本﹔
29171,愛雖難答﹐恩難報﹐惟願讚美得好﹗
29172,Naught have I gotten but what I received;
29173,Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;
29174,"Boasting excluded, pride I abase;"
29175,I'm only a sinner saved by grace!
29176,Only a sinner saved by grace!
29177,"This is my story, to God be the glory,"
29178,"Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,"
29179,Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
29180,"Jesus hath found me, happy my case;"
29181,I now am a sinner saved by grace!
29182,"Tears unavailing, no merit had I;"
29183,"Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;"
29184,"Sin had alarmed me, fearing God's face;"
29185,But now I'm a sinner saved by grace!
29186,"Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,"
29187,Loving his Saviour to tell what he knows;
29188,Once more to tell it would I embrace —
29189,一切我所有﹐無非是接受﹐
29190,全是恩所賜﹐在我信之後﹔
29191,所以不自誇﹐也不自尊﹐
29192,我是一個罪人蒙主恩﹗
29193,我是個罪人蒙主恩﹗
29194,這是我身分﹐榮耀歸給神﹐
29195,從前我愚昧﹐罪惡轄我心﹐
29196,使我的腳步完全遠離神﹔
29197,今被主尋回﹐能不歡欣﹖
29198,現今是個罪人蒙主恩﹗
29199,流淚有何用﹐功行有何效﹖
29200,若非神憐憫﹐滅亡怎能逃﹖
29201,前我因有罪﹐不敢近神﹐
29202,我愛我救主﹐心中樂歡騰﹐
29203,我這蒙恩人不能不說明﹔
29204,讓我再說明-用盡聲音﹕
29205,"I love Thy Kingdom, Lord,"
29206,"The house of Thine abode,"
29207,The church our blest Redeemer saved
29208,With His own precious blood.
29209,"I love Thy church, O God!"
29210,"Her walls before Thee stand,"
29211,Dear as the apple of Thine eye
29212,And graven on Thy hand.
29213,"For her my tears shall fall,"
29214,For her my prayers ascend;
29215,To her my cares and toils be given
29216,Till toils and cares shall end.
29217,Beyond my highest joy
29218,"I prize her heav'nly ways,"
29219,"Her sweet communion, solemn vows,"
29220,Her hymns of love and praise.
29221,"Jesus, Thou Friend divine,"
29222,"Our Saviour and our King,"
29223,Thy hand from every snare and foe
29224,Shall great deliv'rance bring.
29225,"Sure as Thy truth shall last,"
29226,To Zion shall be giv'n
29227,The brightest glories earth can yield
29228,And brighter bliss of heav'n.
29229,主﹐我愛祢國度﹐
29230,就是祢的居所﹔
29231,就是教會-祢所救贖﹐
29232,就是祢的傑作。
29233,神﹐我愛祢教會﹐
29234,她是祢心奇珍﹔
29235,祢對待她愛護入微﹐
29236,猶如眼中瞳仁。
29237,為她我常求呼﹐
29238,為她我常哀哭﹐
29239,為她我常操心勞碌﹐
29240,直到日子滿足。
29241,我寶貴她特點﹐
29242,-遠超最高喜樂-
29243,甘甜交通﹐真誠奉獻﹐
29244,愛和讚美之歌。
29245,耶穌﹐神聖朋友﹐
29246,我的救主、君王﹔
29247,大能的手施行拯救﹐
29248,脫離仇敵、羅網。
29249,正如真理永存﹐
29250,錫安必蒙賜福﹔
29251,地上最大榮耀無盡﹐
29252,天上更大豐富。
29253,"Loved with ever-lasting love,"
29254,Led by grace that love to know;
29255,"Spirit, breathing from above,"
29256,Thou hast taught me it is so.
29257,"Oh, this full and perfect peace!"
29258,"Oh, the transport all divine!"
29259,"In a love which cannot cease,"
29260,"I am His, and He is mine;"
29261,"I am His, and He is mine."
29262,"Heaven above is softer blue,"
29263,Earth around is sweeter green;
29264,Something lives in every hue
29265,Christless eyes have never seen;
29266,"Birds with gladder songs o'erflow,"
29267,"Flow'rs with deeper beauties shine,"
29268,"Since I know, as now I know,"
29269,Things that once were wild alarms
29270,Cannot now disturb my rest;
29271,"Closed in everlasting arms,"
29272,Pillowed on the loving breast.
29273,"Oh, to lie forever here,"
29274,"Doubt and care and self resign,"
29275,"While He whispers in my ear,"
29276,"His forever, only His:"
29277,Who the Lord and me shall part?
29278,"Ah, with what a rest of bliss"
29279,Christ can fill the loving heart.
29280,"Heav'n and earth may fade and flee,"
29281,Firstborn light in gloom decline;
29282,"But, while God and I shall be,"
29283,"I am His, and He is mine. But,"
29284,"While God and I shall be,"
29285,主永遠的愛愛我﹐
29286,這愛藉恩我深知﹔
29287,聖靈從上正輕語﹐
29288,為將此愛來指示。
29289,哦﹐這豐滿的平安﹗
29290,哦﹐這神聖的歡樂﹗
29291,在這不息愛裏面﹐
29292,我是屬祂﹐祂屬我﹔
29293,我是屬祂﹐祂屬我。
29294,頭上之天何蔚藍﹐
29295,四周之地也青綠﹔
29296,有一景色更鮮艷﹐
29297,無主之目從未睹﹔
29298,鳥鳴聲音更可悅﹐
29299,花美使我更快活﹔
29300,自從我心能領略﹕
29301,有事曾使我驚恐﹐
29302,今不再擾我安息﹔
29303,靠在永久膀臂中﹐
29304,枕在愛的胸懷裏。
29305,哦﹐願永遠臥於此﹐
29306,憂疑、自己﹐全逃脫﹔
29307,當祂柔聲的指示﹐
29308,我是永遠只屬祂﹐
29309,誰能使祂與我分?
29310,祂在我心來安家﹐
29311,有福安息滿我心。
29312,天地可以都廢去﹐
29313,日月也可全衰落﹔
29314,但主與我永同居﹐
29315,"Sing the wondrous love of Jesus, sing His mercy and His grace;"
29316,In the mansions bright and blessed He'll prepare for us a place.
29317,"When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be!"
29318,"When we all see Jesus, we'll sing and shout the victory."
29319,While we walk the pilgrim pathway clouds will overspread the sky;
29320,"But when trav'ling days are over, not a shadow, not a sigh."
29321,"Let us then be true and faithful, trusting, serving every day;"
29322,Just one glimpse of Him in glory will the toils of life repay.
29323,Onward to the prize before us! Soon His beauty we'll behold;
29324,"Soon the pearly gates will open, we shall tread the streets of gold."
29325,歌頌耶穌奇妙大愛，讚祂憐憫與恩待；
29326,何等居所光明、榮美，祂已為我們豫備。
29327,當我們都回天家，那是何等歡喜相聚之日！
29328,我們要面見祂，並要高唱得勝新詩。
29329,我今行走客旅路途，烏雲常瀰漫四佈；
29330,有日當我旅程完畢，再無陰影與歎息。
29331,我們今當忠誠、真摯，每日交託，勤服事；
29332,只要那日榮面一瞥，所有辛酸得慰藉。
29333,恩賞不遠，努力向前！祂的榮面快望見；
29334,不久天城珠門將開，我們逍遙黃金街。
29335,"Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,"
29336,"Nor creed, nor form, nor word;"
29337,"Nor holy church, nor human love,"
29338,"Compare with Thee, my Lord!"
29339,Thy love has conquered me;
29340,"Beneath Thy cross I die to self,"
29341,And live alone to Thee.
29342,My inmost being fill;
29343,"So shall I think as Thou dost think,"
29344,And will as Thou dost will.
29345,Thy life transfigure mine;
29346,"And through this veil of mortal flesh,"
29347,"Lord, let Thy splendor shine."
29348,My soul exults in Thee;
29349,"To be Thy slave, to do Thy will,"
29350,Is my felicity.
29351,願祢為大﹐哦﹐主耶穌！
29352,信條、話語、虛儀、
29353,屬人的會、屬世的愛﹐
29354,不能與祢相比。
29355,祢愛征服了我﹔
29356,靠祢十架﹐我向己死﹐
29357,完全為祢而活。
29358,全人被祢充滿﹔
29359,使我思想像祢思想﹐
29360,喜歡像祢喜歡。
29361,把我改變全備﹔
29362,從這幔子（軟弱肉體）﹐
29363,顯出祢的榮美。
29364,我心真是要求﹕
29365,作祢奴僕﹐行祢旨意﹐
29366,一生不再自由。
29367,"What a fellowship, what a joy divine,"
29368,Resting on the everlasting arms;
29369,"What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,"
29370,Resting on the everlasting arms.
29371,"Resting, resting, Safe and secure from all alarms;"
29372,"Resting, resting, resting on the everlasting arms."
29373,"Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,"
29374,"Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day,"
29375,"What have I to dread, what have I to fear,"
29376,Resting on the everlasting arms?
29377,"I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,"
29378,交通何甜美，喜樂何豐盈，
29379,安息在那永久膀臂中；
29380,福氣何全備，平安何神聖，
29381,安息在那永久膀臂中。
29382,安息！安息！平安穩妥，一無驚恐；
29383,安息！安息！安息在那永久膀臂中。
29384,今行這旅程，心中滿平安，
29385,越行越光明，恩光照燦爛，
29386,有何我所懼？有何我所怕？
29387,與主永同居，平安無復加，
29388,"Live out Thy life within me,"
29389,"O Jesus, King of kings!"
29390,Be Thou Thyself the answer
29391,To all my questionings.
29392,In all things have Thy way!
29393,"I, the transparent medium"
29394,Thy glory to display.
29395,The temple has been yielded
29396,And purified of sin;
29397,Let Thy Shekinah glory
29398,Now flash forth from within.
29399,"And all the earth keep silence,"
29400,The body henceforth be
29401,"Thy silent, docile servant,"
29402,Moved only as by Thee.
29403,Its members every moment
29404,Held subject to Thy call;
29405,"Ready to have Thee use them,"
29406,Or not be used at all.
29407,"Held without restless longing,"
29408,"Or strain or stress or fret,"
29409,"Or chafings at Thy dealings,"
29410,Or thoughts of vain regret.
29411,"But restful, calm and pliant,"
29412,"From bend and bias free,"
29413,Permitting Thee to settle
29414,When Thou hast need of me.
29415,Be Thou the glorious answer
29416,從我活出祢的自己﹐
29417,耶穌﹐祢是我生命﹔
29418,對於我的所有問題﹐
29419,求祢以祢為答應。
29420,一切事上能隨意﹔
29421,我不過是透明用器﹐
29422,為著彰顯祢祕密。
29423,殿宇今已完全奉獻﹐
29424,已除所有的不潔﹔
29425,但願祢的榮耀火焰﹐
29426,今從裡面就露顯。
29427,全地現在都當肅穆﹐
29428,我的身體今進供﹔
29429,作祢順服、安靜奴僕﹐
29430,只有被祢來推動。
29431,所有肢體每個時刻﹐
29432,約束、等候祢發言﹔
29433,準備為祢前來負軛﹐
29434,或是不用放一邊。
29435,約束﹐沒有不安追求﹐
29436,沒有緊張和受壓﹔
29437,沒有因受對付怨尤﹐
29438,沒有因懊悔倒下。
29439,乃是柔軟、安靜、安息﹐
29440,脫離傾向與成見﹔
29441,讓祢能夠自由定意﹐
29442,當祢對我有指點。
29443,How deep the Father's love for us
29444,"How vast beyond all measure,"
29445,That He should give His only Son
29446,To make a wretch His treasure.
29447,How great the pain of searing loss;
29448,"The Father turns His face away,"
29449,As wounds which mar the Chosen One
29450,Bring many sons to glory.
29451,"Behold the Man upon a cross,"
29452,My sin upon His shoulder;
29453,"Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice,"
29454,Call out among the scoffers.
29455,It was my sin that held Him there;
29456,Until it was accomplished;
29457,"His dying breath has brought me life,"
29458,I know that it is finished.
29459,"I will not boast in anything,"
29460,"No gifts, no power, no wisdom;"
29461,"But I will boast in Jesus Christ,"
29462,His death and resurrection.
29463,Why should I gain from His reward?
29464,I cannot give an answer.
29465,But this I know with all my heart;
29466,His wounds have paid my ransom.
29467,父阿！祢賜何等慈愛，
29468,長闊高深難測度；
29469,祢竟甘願捨祢愛子，
29470,來救罪魁成珍寶；
29471,十架上任祂被壓傷，
29472,掩臉不顧祂痛苦；
29473,父阿！這是何等捨棄，
29474,為使眾子得榮耀。
29475,看哪！我主被掛架上，
29476,我罪都由祂承擔；
29477,無知罪人，不識恩典，
29478,曾經嘲笑拒絕祂；
29479,全因我罪，神子被釘，
29480,奇妙救贖今成了；
29481,我今方知完全救恩，
29482,因祂死，我得生命。
29483,不敢誇口自己所有，
29484,恩賜智慧與能力；
29485,高聲稱頌基督神子，
29486,為我死又為我活；
29487,罪人為何今得恩寵，
29488,妙愛我難知究竟；
29489,只知罪債祂代清償，
29490,主賜稱義的把握。
29491,We bring the sacrifice of praise
29492,Into the house of the Lord;
29493,We bring the sacrifice of praise
29494,Into the house of the Lord;
29495,And we offer up to You
29496,The sacrifices of thanksgiving;
29497,And we offer up to You
29498,The sacrifices of joy!
29499,我們獻上讚美為祭，
29500,進前來到主殿中；
29501,我們獻上讚美為祭，
29502,進前來到主殿中。
29503,我們來全心敬拜，
29504,獻上我們心中的感謝；
29505,我們來全心獻上
29506,歡欣的頌讚為祭。
29507,"O Lord, as we consider Thee,"
29508,We worship Thee for all Thou art;
29509,"Thou art so rich, so wonderful,"
29510,So dear and precious to our heart.
29511,What Thou art meets our ev'ry need!
29512,Our hearts o'erflow with praise to Thee!
29513,All our desires Thou dost exceed
29514,And satisfy continually.
29515,"Thou art the very God in truth,"
29516,The God who is both love and light;
29517,"The God who is to us our life,"
29518,The God in whom we all delight.
29519,"Thou also art a man indeed,"
29520,"A man so fine, so good, so pure;"
29521,"A man in whom our God delights,"
29522,A man who can our love secure.
29523,"Thou even art a lowly slave,"
29524,A slave of God to serve for us;
29525,Obedient to the cross's death
29526,That we might be delivered thus.
29527,"Thou art, beside all these, a King,"
29528,"A King in life and love to reign,"
29529,By God anointed with His pow'r
29530,To rule with us in His domain.
29531,"Dear Lord, as we remember Thee,"
29532,We thus partake of all Thou art;
29533,"As we enjoy Thyself in love,"
29534,We share Thee as Thy counterpart.
29535,哦主，當我們想到祢，
29536,因祢所是，我們敬拜，
29537,祢是如此豐富奇妙，
29538,最愛最親，滿足我心。
29539,主祢所是，滿我所需，
29540,我心充滿稱頌讚美！
29541,凡我所缺，祢全供應，
29542,我今滿足，直到永遠。
29543,惟有祢是獨一真神，
29544,神祢是愛，祢又是光，
29545,祢是生命，祢是能力，
29546,得在主裡，何等歡喜。
29547,主哦，祢竟又是人子，
29548,何等良善，何等完全，
29549,父神喜悅獨生愛子，
29550,滿愛的主，我心歸祢。
29551,因愛，祢取奴僕形像，
29552,服事我們以至於死，
29553,全心順服，十架捨命，
29554,我們得贖，得主生命。
29555,恩主，祢是萬王之王，
29556,生命的主，慈愛之君，
29557,神所膏立，何等榮耀，
29558,領率我們同掌王權。
29559,哦主，我們今來記念，
29560,得享祢的一切豐富，
29561,飽嘗祢愛，祢的所是，
29562,我得分享，直到永遠。
29563,"Jesus, how lovely You are,"
29564,"You are so gentle, so pure and so kind."
29565,You shine like the morning star.
29566,"Jesus, how lovely You are."
29567,耶穌！祢何等可愛，
29568,對我何溫柔，慈愛又情深。
29569,耶穌，祢是明亮晨星，
29570,耶穌！祢何等可愛。
29571,No more condemned ever justified
29572,"O, What peace and joy in my heart!"
29573,"All my sins cleansed by His precious blood,"
29574,Peace and Joy now calm my heart.
29575,"Hallelujah, matchless His grace,"
29576,Christ has cleansed my sin within.
29577,"Once a prodigal, now come home,"
29578,Adorned with His righteous robe.
29579,"For in Christ, there's no condemnation,"
29580,"O, What peace and joy in my heart!"
29581,"I am covered with His righteousness,"
29582,Peace and joy now fill my heart
29583,"Not condemned e'en on that judgment day,"
29584,"O, What peace and joy in my heart!"
29585,"In the Book of Life my name is found,"
29586,Peace and Joy now calm my heart.
29587,Who can bring charge against God's elect?
29588,"O, What peace and joy in my heart!"
29589,"Perfect salvation, Christ died for me,"
29590,Peace and joy now rule my heart.
29591,"因信稱義,永不再定罪,"
29592,是何等平安、喜樂！
29593,靠主寶血洗除眾污穢，
29594,是何等平安、喜樂！
29595,哈利路亞，救恩浩大！
29596,悔改淚惟主能擦；
29597,前為浪子，今已歸家，
29598,身穿義袍極榮華。
29599,在基督裏，永不再定罪，
29600,是何等平安、喜樂！
29601,我的罪身被主義遮蔽，
29602,是何等平安、喜樂！
29603,到審判日，決不至定罪，

29715,"You laid aside Your majesty, gave up ev'rything for me,"
29716,Suffered at the hands of those You had created.
29717,"You took all my guilt and shame, when You died and rose again;"

29721,Forever and ever; I will love You.
29722,"You are the only one who died for me, gave Your life to set me free,"
29723,So I lift my voice to You in adoration.
29724,啊主！祢曾撇下尊貴，為我竟一切全捨，
29725,受世人逼害，最終竟被釘十架。
29726,為我死又為我活，甘心擔我罪與羞；
29727,今作王，被高舉，所有權柄屬祢。
29728,我今全心俯伏敬拜，我主，

29736,"The price is paid, Alleluia,"
29737,"Amazing grace, so strong and sure"
29738,"And so with all my heart, my life in ev'ry part,"
29739,I live to thank You for the price You paid.
29740,"The price is paid, see Satan flee away;"
29741,For Jesus crucified destroys his power.
29742,"No more to pay, let accusation cease,"
29743,In Christ there is no condemnation now.
29744,"The price is paid, and by that scourging cruel"
29745,He took our sicknesses as if His own.
29746,And by His wounds His body broken there.
29747,His healing touch may now by faith be known.

29921,作贖罪祭，神的羔羊。
29922,前我失喪，沉淪無望，

29926,"When the music fades, all is stripped away, and I simply come;"
29927,Longing just to bring something that's of worth that will bless Your heart.
29928,"I'll bring You more than a song,"
29929,For a song in itself is not what You have required.
29930,You search much deeper within through the way things appear;
29931,You're looking into my heart.
29932,"I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about You,"

29939,我雖獻上讚美歌，
29940,美妙歌音未能真正滿足主的心，
29941,我心深處漸明白祢藉萬物指明，
29942,祢要我心全歸祢。
29943,哦，我是何等愚昧，今知道惟有祢是一切，
29944,不提自己勞苦，只獻全心來敬拜，敬拜祢，
29945,惟有主是一切，惟有主是一切
29946,榮耀的君王，當配得讚美，遠超口傳述，
29947,雖我貧又弱，惟生命氣息都是在乎祢。
29948,"We worship and adore Thee, bowing down before Thee,"
29949,"Songs of praises singing, Hallelujahs ringing;"

30028,來看我主手和腳，其上釘痕，大愛明彰，
30029,那調動宇宙雙手，竟然任憑釘穿透。

30234,我們渴慕得見祢丰采。
30235,願祢快來，哦！主耶穌，來！
30236,當祢子民一同聚集，
30237,祢藉聖靈顯同在；

30239,但我渴慕那天面對面。
30240,我們儆醒，望祢快顯，
30241,直到脫下這帳棚；

30243,但在今天禱告仍不住。
30244,萬物歎息，勞苦悲傷，
30245,等祢榮耀的顯現；
30246,我淚不止，眼目迷矇，
30247,主啊！何時應我心呼求？
30248,My whole body and soul all for Thee.

30256,Than when we first begun.
30257,神啊，縱然天地廢去，
30258,太陽不展光芒；
30259,但那召我得生的主，
30260,仍必永遠屬我。
30261,當我見主千萬年後，
30262,仍像太陽照耀；
30263,直到永世，無盡讚美，
30264,讚美永不減少。
30265,"Mine in life's lowly ways,"
30266,Mine in life's common days.
30267,"Strength of my helplessness,"

30272,"Bitt'r cup He drank, love feast I taste;"
30273,Such love and grace — none to compare
30274,O Lord! My heart will ne'er forget.
